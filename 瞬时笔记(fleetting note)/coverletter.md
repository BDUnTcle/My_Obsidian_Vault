I took some programming language courses during my bachelor，such as C/C++ and Java as well as some application design related course like Android application design and object-oriented design. In my master's program at San Jose State University I've taken the system and algorithm courses which built me a robust understanding and comprehension in coding and software design. I learned how to use various of kinds of design patterns，multiple programming languages（Java，C/C++，Python）and have several project experiences.

I  designed and compleded several GUI application during my former work, including Windows, Linux as well as Android platform. Some of them are still deployed in my former company now. I've experienced in Qt which is a commonly used API library and framework for GUI development.

> I have extensive experience designing and implementing GUI applications across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and Android, during my previous role. Some of these applications are currently deployed within my former company. My proficiency extends to Qt, a widely-used API library and framework for GUI development

I have extensive experience in object-oriented programming. In my previous role, I primarily focused on desktop and embedded cross-platform application development. However, due to the project requirements of the company, I also designed and developed Android applications

Before pursuing my master's degree, I worked as a software engineer for 4 years. These professional experiences provided me with invaluable insights, including hands-on involvement in multi-team projects and a solid foundation in software development technologies, which I consider a significant advantage. I am confident in my ability to seamlessly integrate into a team environment and contribute to the design, optimization, and related coding tasks. Furthermore, I believe my aptitude for learning and interpersonal skills are exceptional. I utilized my time effectively during employment to pursue further studies and prepare for my master's application, successfully securing opportunities to enhance my skills abroad. These qualities collectively represent the attributes of an outstanding team member.

I have always had a strong interest in computers, which led me to pursue a degree in Electrical Engineering during my college years. However, throughout my studies, I discovered a deeper passion for programming and software development. I enjoy exploring the nuances of various programming languages, comparing their strengths and weaknesses in different scenarios, and delving into their underlying design principles. Efficiency is also a key focus for me, as I constantly strive to optimize my work and ensure adherence to best practices in software design.

One of the most rewarding aspects of software development for me is the sense of accomplishment I feel when I successfully design and implement algorithms, small applications, or even entire projects, and witness them running smoothly. These moments serve as great sources of motivation for me and are the aspects of software development that I cherish the most.

During my first year at my previous full-time job, I was tasked with spearheading a brand-new project, which involved building a framework from scratch and deploying it in an embedded Linux environment. This period marked one of the most memorable phases of my career so far. I frequently collaborated with my previous team members and team leaders, seeking their guidance on design considerations and drawing from the experiences of mature projects within the company. Ultimately, my efforts culminated in the successful implementation of the new project, which continued to undergo iterative upgrades even after my departure.
