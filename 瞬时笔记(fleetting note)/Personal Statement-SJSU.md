#PS草稿 
从小到大，我一直认为我是一个不会轻易被困难和生活中的挫折绊倒的人。身边的朋友常对我说的话是：”这个问题交给你后，大家可有盼头啦“，”有你加入，事半功倍啊“。这些认同和赞扬也更加让我勇于面对和解决各种挑战。我在12岁随同父母去泰山旅游时，面对一个依靠滑索单人穿越山谷的挑战项目，我并没有像很多人一样选择放弃挑战，而是激动地参加了。对克服这个未知挑战的期待和激动毫无悬念地压过了恐惧的心情。我至今记得我依靠着滑索穿越至对面时的激动和喜悦。记得高三最后那阵子，距离高考只有半年，在晚自习结束后，我会选择留下多做一份模拟考试题来巩固对已学的知识。结束后回到寝室已经是转点时分。打开宿舍大门，室友们都已经深深睡去。最终，我以班里的第一名的成绩被一本大学录取。那段时间的刻苦经历也让我感受良多。大学毕业参加工作以来，我踏实，细致认真的态度，帮助了我很多。

2020年，入职不到1年，还是新人的我，正遇上了公司新的商业项目，需要为客户定制一套车载移动测量平台。它对当时的我来说并不简单。彼时组内人员也无暇分工，最后我主动向上级提议接下了这个任务。那6个月是我开发经验突飞猛进的一段时间，我一开始不得不一点点的学习和总结之前没接触过的开发内容。期间也多次出差给客户解决实地问题。在项目交付期之前最后两个月的时间里，为了保证交付成功，我单人出差至客户所在地的青岛。在那一个多月里，我作为公司研发代表，每天都积极地和客户沟通，根据客户的具体要求和意见修订软件最终版本，同时陪同客户一起，见证了项目的最终交付。那一刻，我心里悬着的石头才最终落下，同时又一次地对自己说到：我做到了。事后回到公司，市场部门同事和我说道，客户对我的工作赞赏有佳。听到这番话惊喜的同时，我也更确定了今后依然要坚持我这样的行事准则。

我一直觉得，在美国这篇新兴和富有活力的国家里学习，是一件令人向往的事。所以当我选择大学院校时，浏览官网和介绍，SJSU第一时间便俘获了我的心。美国硅谷，对于全世界所有计算机工程师和高科技领域人才来说，都是梦想里的圣地。而圣何塞州立大学，坐落于硅谷心脏的圣何塞，它充满创新，朝气蓬勃。我越来越难以抑制心里涌出的期望和憧憬，尤其是看到学校所宣传的”改变“的主旨和其中一个个在此就学期间完成了惊人人生转变的学生和职工们的自述，让我不禁想到：如果能在这样优秀的大学里学习和生活，这一定会成为我人生中最难忘，最精彩的一段回忆！同时让我完成一次惊人的蜕变！另外，我注意到学校里亚洲学生占比第一，超过了总人数的三分之一。作为一位希望赴美留学的中国人，我感受到无与伦比的亲切感。
我选择计算机科学的原因有很多，包括各种个人因素和社会因素。第一，作为电子信息工程专业毕业的我，从大学期间就一直保持着对计算机的浓厚兴趣。毕业以来，我一直从事着软件开发的工作，对计算机的热爱让我无论是工作中还是业余时间都主动地接触和学习各种各样的专业知识。第二，圣何塞大学的计算机科学学科排名优异，这里有着硅谷中心的地位和优秀的师资团队，教育历史。无数从大学毕业的才子们都在社会里证明了圣何塞大学教学的优秀。这里的教育是获得全世界范围的计算机人士认可的。能从这样一所名校学习计算机毕业，并且能够积累实习机会，对我的工作前景是一份很有力的能力证明，能在自己的目标道路上越走越好。希望如果学成归国，我能成为多方争抢的人才。最后，计算机科学的适应性很强，电子信息化的当今社会，社会的发展离不开计算机知识的帮助，不管在什么样的方面。当今世界是个全球化的市场，电子信息已经渗入各行各业的方方面面，这个专业也深深吸引着我，相信继续在这条道路上探索，能最大程度地找到发挥自己特长的机会。

Ever since I was young, I have always believed that I am a person who is not easily tripped up by difficulties and setbacks in life. Words that my friends often say to me are: "With you handling it, everyone can rest assured," and "With you on the team, things are twice as easy." These affirmations and praises have also made me more courageous in facing and solving various challenges. When I was 12 years old, I went on a tour of Mount Tai with my parents, and faced a challenge of crossing a valley by single-handedly sliding through a cable. Unlike many people, I did not choose to give up the challenge, but excitedly participated in it. The excitement and anticipation of conquering this unknown challenge undoubtedly overpowered the fear. I still remember the excitement and joy I felt when I relied on the cable to cross to the other side. I also remember the period during my senior year of high school, when there were only six months left before the college entrance examination, and after evening self-study, I would choose to stay behind to do an extra set of practice test questions to consolidate what I had learned. When I returned to the dormitory after finishing, it was already past midnight. When I opened the door to the dormitory, all of my roommates were already fast asleep. In the end, I was admitted to a university with the first place grade in my class. The experience of those days of hard work also made me feel a lot. Since graduating from university and starting work, my steady, meticulous, and serious attitude has helped me a lot. 

In 2020, within less than a year of starting my job, I was faced with my company's new business project, which required me to customize a mobile measurement platform for a car. It was not simple for me at the time. The team at the time also had no time to divide the work, and I ended up proposing to my superiors that I take on this task. Those six months were some of the most challenging and rewarding times in my life. Despite encountering many difficulties and setbacks, I persevered and finally completed the project to the satisfaction of both the company and the customer. This experience allowed me to grow and gain recognition in my job, and also made me realize that I have the ability to overcome challenges and achieve my goals.

I have always felt that studying in the United States, a new and vibrant country, is a desirable thing. So when I chose a university, I browsed the official website and introduction, and SJSU immediately captured my heart. Silicon Valley, the holy land of dreams for all computer engineers and high-tech personnel in the world, is located in San José, the heart of Silicon Valley. SJSU is full of innovation and vigor. I became increasingly unable to suppress the expectations and aspirations that sprang up in my heart, especially when I saw the "transformative" theme promoted by the school and the self-narratives of students and staff who had completed amazing transformations during their studies at SJSU. I couldn't help thinking: If I could study and live in such an excellent university, it would surely be the most unforgettable and wonderful memory of my life! At the same time, it would complete an amazing metamorphosis for me! In addition, I noticed that the proportion of Asian students in the school is the first, accounting for more than one-third of the total number. As a Chinese person hoping to study abroad in the United States, I feel unparalleled warmth. 

There are many reasons why I chose computer science, including various personal and social factors. First, as a graduate of electronic information engineering, I have always maintained a strong interest in computers since college. Since graduating, I have been engaged in software development work, and my love for computers has made me actively contact and learn various professional knowledge in my work and leisure time. Second, San José State University's computer science program is well-known and has a good reputation, and I believe that studying there will definitely improve my professional level. Third, the school's location in Silicon Valley is very attractive to me. Silicon Valley is a gathering place for cutting-edge technologies and top companies in the world, and studying there will provide me with numerous opportunities to intern in these companies and learn from their experts. Finally, studying abroad in the United States will also help me improve my English skills and broaden my horizons. In conclusion, I believe that studying computer science at SJSU will be a valuable and meaningful experience for me.

In life and work, I firmly believe that I have the ability to overcome difficulties and setbacks, and I also enjoy accepting challenges. I believe that this attitude is the key to my progress, and it is also the reason why I persist in life and work. I believe that as long as I firmly believe in myself and dare to face challenges, I can achieve success.

“大家抱着兴趣来参加竞赛，如果被一点点困难打倒，就对不起我们这两周的努力了。我不应该和你们赌气，拒绝和你们交流，现在只剩一周的时间，我反而不在意最终我们能取得什么样的成绩了。我们作为组内同伴一起互相交流，互相努力。相信这也是这次竞赛想要让我们从分组合作中学习到的事吧”。我向组里的同伴鼓励道。这是我大学第一学期假期，我参加了学院里的一个电子设计竞赛。比赛以小组为单位，我和班里的另外3人组成了一个小组。课题是设计和完成一款稳压电源。然而过程中却并不顺利。一开始，我们4人分工好各自的任务。但是随着时间推进，我发现几位同伴失去了兴趣。询问后他们回答道“一开始我们是挺有兴趣的，但是中途发现设计上的困难好多。有些东西根本没学过。何况现在是暑假，想放弃了。”我尝试劝说大家一起加油，不过没有效果。于是我抱着一个人完成任务的心态，也不再管我的队友了。在接下来的日子里，我也发现整个内容我一个是无法完成的，我原先的任务也因为设计上的困难卡壳了。就这样到了最后一周，还是没什么进展。我终于意识到为什么学院要求我们分组以及分工合作，互相交流的重要性。而当我说完后，同伴们也重燃信心。在最后一周里，我们又找回了一开始的兴趣，每天都在一起商量和解决遇到的困难，推进进度。虽然最后我们依然没有完成整个项目的设计，也没有取得名次。但是对于我来说，不仅在专业知识上有了实践的经验，最重要的是我认识到了团队和沟通的重要性。

"Everyone is interested in participating in the competition. If we are defeated by a little difficulty, we will be sorry for our efforts in the past two weeks. I should not be angry with you and refuse to communicate with you. Now there is only one week left, but I don't care what we can achieve in the end. We communicate with each other and work together as partners in the group. I believe this is what the competition wants us to learn from group cooperation." 。 I encouraged my teammates in the group. This is my first semester vacation in college. I participated in an electronic design competition in the college. The competition is organized in groups. I formed a group with three other people in my class. 
The task is to design and complete a regulated power supply. 
However, the process was not smooth. At the beginning, the four of us divided our tasks well. But as time went on, I found that several of my companions lost interest. After asking, they replied, "At first, we were very interested, but we found many difficulties in design. Some things were not learned at all. What's more, it's summer vacation now, and I want to give up." I tried to persuade everyone to cheer together, but it didn't work. So I took the attitude of completing the task by myself and stopped caring about my teammates. In the following days, I also found that I could not complete the whole content, and my original task was stuck due to the difficulties in design. So until the last week, there was still no progress. I finally realized why the college requires us to divide into groups and the importance of cooperate and communicate with each other. And when I finished, my companions also regained their confidence. In the last week, we regained our initial interest and discussed and solved the difficulties we encountered together every day to advance the progress. Although in the end, we still haven't finished the design of the whole project . But for me, I not only have practical experience in professional knowledge, but also realize the importance of teamwork and communication in my life.In 2020, within less than a year of starting my job, I was faced with my company's new business project, which required me to customize a mobile measurement platform for a car. It was not simple for me at the time. The team at the time also had no time to divide the work, and I ended up proposing to my superiors that I take on this task. Those six months were some of the most challenging and rewarding times in my life. Despite encountering many difficulties and setbacks, I persevered and finally completed the project to the satisfaction of both the company and the customer. This experience allowed me to grow and gain recognition in my job, and also made me realize that I have the ability to overcome challenges and achieve my goals.I have always felt that studying in the United States, a new and vibrant country, is a desirable thing.Although there still have some challeges to me ,but I think I can overcome it.First, my undergraduate major is EE, and I hope to apply for a major related to CS. I think there will be some challenges in relevant courses (such as mathematics and algorithms). This is because I have graduated and worked for a period of time, and have less contact with some knowledge of biased theory. But I have the confidence to face these challenges. During this period of work, I will still use my spare time after work or weekends to learn some computer courses, such as listening to some open courses of computer theory in famous American colleges, or learning relevant knowledge by myself through books. And this is my interest and hobby, so I will not feel bored and resistant when contacting them.The other reason is  I have never studied and lived in an environment other than my mother tongue. I think this will be another challenge for me. However,I do not resist foreign culture. In order to integrate into the environment of American universities and American culture faster and better, I strive to improve my English level and aim to pass the TOEFL exam. At the same time, I have more contact with songs, movies, radio podcasts and so on related to American culture. This has not brought me too much trouble, because I have always taken the initiative to enjoy foreign music and movies, and take it as a pleasure.
