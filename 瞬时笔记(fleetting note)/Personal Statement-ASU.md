从小到大，我一直认为我是一个不会轻易被困难和生活中的挫折绊倒的人。身边的朋友常对我说的话是：”这个问题交给你后，大家可有盼头啦“，”有你加入，事半功倍啊“。这些认同和赞扬也更加让我勇于面对和解决各种挑战。我在12岁随同父母去泰山旅游时，面对一个依靠滑索单人穿越山谷的挑战项目，我并没有像很多人一样选择放弃挑战，而是激动地参加了。对克服这个未知挑战的期待和激动毫无悬念地压过了恐惧的心情。我至今记得我依靠着滑索穿越至对面时的激动和喜悦。记得高三最后那阵子，距离高考只有半年，在晚自习结束后，我会选择留下多做一份模拟考试题来巩固对已学的知识。结束后回到寝室已经是转点时分。打开宿舍大门，室友们都已经深深睡去。最终，我以班里的第一名的成绩被一本大学录取。那段时间的刻苦经历也让我感受良多。大学毕业参加工作以来，我踏实，细致认真的态度，帮助了我很多。

2020年，入职不到1年，还是新人的我，正遇上了公司新的商业项目，需要为客户定制一套车载移动测量平台。它对当时的我来说并不简单。彼时组内人员也无暇分工，最后我主动向上级提议接下了这个任务。那6个月是我开发经验突飞猛进的一段时间，我一开始不得不一点点的学习和总结之前没接触过的开发内容。期间也多次出差给客户解决实地问题。在项目交付期之前最后两个月的时间里，为了保证交付成功，我单人出差至客户所在地的青岛。在那一个多月里，我作为公司研发代表，每天都积极地和客户沟通，根据客户的具体要求和意见修订软件最终版本，同时陪同客户一起，见证了项目的最终交付。那一刻，我心里悬着的石头才最终落下，同时又一次地对自己说到：我做到了。事后回到公司，市场部门同事和我说道，客户对我的工作赞赏有佳。听到这番话惊喜的同时，我也更确定了今后依然要坚持我这样的行事准则。

我一直觉得，在美国这篇新兴和富有活力的国家里学习，是一件令人向往的事。所以当我选择大学院校时，浏览官网和介绍，ASU第一时间便俘获了我的心。在我浏览ASU的官方网页时，Innovation这个词让我印象深刻，它出现在各个子页面里。是的，ASU在我心目中就是这样一个历史悠久同时有充满创新，朝气蓬勃的院校。1885年创校至今，ASU不曾固步自封，一直在追求创新和作为美国一流大学的路上行进着。我越来越难以抑制心里涌出的期望和憧憬，尤其是看到学校的宣传语”We are measured not by whom we exclude, but by whom we include and how they succeed“ ，”Together, there are no limits“。生活中我一直是一个不守旧，不断寻求突破和变化的人。ASU对innovation的坚持以及丰富而全面的方方面面让我感觉到这太符合我梦里对大学院校的梦想了。 我不禁想到：如果能在这样优秀的大学里学习和生活，这一定会成为我人生中最难忘，最精彩的一段回忆！同时会因为这段学习经历让我完成一次惊人的蜕变！
我选择计算机科学的原因有很多，包括各种个人因素和社会因素。第一，作为电子信息工程专业毕业的我，从大学期间就一直保持着对计算机的浓厚兴趣。毕业以来，我一直从事着软件开发的工作，对计算机的热爱让我无论是工作中还是业余时间都主动地接触和学习各种各样的专业知识。第二，亚利桑那州立大学的计算机科学学科排名优异，这里有着全美一流的优秀的师资团队，悠久的教育历史。这里的教育是获得全世界范围的计算机人士认可的。能从这样一所名校学习计算机毕业，并且能够积累实习机会，对我的工作前景是一份很有力的能力证明，能在自己的目标道路上越走越好。希望如果学成归国，我能成为多方争抢的人才。最后，计算机科学的适应性很强，电子信息化的当今社会，社会的发展离不开计算机知识的帮助，不管在什么样的方面。当今世界是个全球化的市场，电子信息已经渗入各行各业的方方面面，这个专业也深深吸引着我，相信继续在这条道路上探索，能最大程度地找到发挥自己特长的机会。

Ever since I was young, I have always believed that I am a person who is not easily tripped up by difficulties and setbacks in life. Words that my friends often say to me are: "With you handling it, everyone can rest assured," and "With you on the team, things are twice as easy." These affirmations and praises have also made me more courageous in facing and solving various challenges. When I was 12 years old, I went on a tour of Mount Tai with my parents, and faced a challenge of crossing a valley by single-handedly sliding through a cable. Unlike many people, I did not choose to give up the challenge, but excitedly participated in it. The excitement and anticipation of conquering this unknown challenge undoubtedly overpowered the fear. I still remember the excitement and joy I felt when I relied on the cable to cross to the other side. I also remember the period during my senior year of high school, when there were only six months left before the college entrance examination, and after evening self-study, I would choose to stay behind to do an extra set of practice test questions to consolidate what I had learned. When I returned to the dormitory after finishing, it was already past midnight. When I opened the door to the dormitory, all of my roommates were already fast asleep. In the end, I was admitted to a university with the first place grade in my class. The experience of those days of hard work also made me feel a lot. Since graduating from university and starting work, my steady, meticulous, and serious attitude has helped me a lot. 

In 2020, within less than a year of starting my job, I was faced with my company's new business project, which required me to customize a mobile measurement platform for a car. It was not simple for me at the time. The team at the time also had no time to divide the work, and I ended up proposing to my superiors that I take on this task. Those six months were some of the most challenging and rewarding times in my life. Despite encountering many difficulties and setbacks, I persevered and finally completed the project to the satisfaction of both the company and the customer. This experience allowed me to grow and gain recognition in my job, and also made me realize that I have the ability to overcome challenges and achieve my goals.

I have always felt that studying in the United States, a new and vibrant country, is something to look forward to. So when I chose a college, I browsed the official website and introduction of ASU and captured my heart at first sight. When I browsed the official website of ASU, the word "innovation" impressed me deeply and appeared on various sub-pages. Yes, in my mind, ASU is such a prestigious and innovative university that is full of vitality. Founded in 1885, it has never been stagnant and has always been on the path to innovation and becoming a first-class university in the United States. I increasingly cannot suppress the expectations and yearnings in my heart, especially seeing the school's slogan ”We are measured not by whom we exclude, but by whom we include and how they succeed“ ,”Together, there are no limits“ I have always been a person who does not stick to the old and constantly seeks breakthroughs and change in life. ASU's insistence on innovation and its rich and comprehensive educational resources make me feel that it fits my dream of a college too well. I cannot help but think: if I can study and live in such an excellent university, it will definitely be the most unforgettable and wonderful memories of my life! At the same time, this study experience will make me complete a shocking transformation! 

There are many reasons why I choose computer science, including various personal factors and social factors. First, as a graduate of electronic information engineering, I have always maintained a strong interest in computers since college. Since graduation, I have been engaged in software development, and my love for computers has made me actively contact and learn various professional knowledge both at work and in my spare time. Second, ASU's strong industry connections and diverse and comprehensive educational resources can provide me with the best preparation for my future career. Third, the computer science industry is a rapidly developing industry, and computer science professionals are in great demand. I believe that studying computer science at ASU will not only improve my professional skills, but also bring me a bright future. In conclusion, I believe that studying at ASU, an innovative and prestigious university with a strong computer science program, will not only be a dream come true, but also a turning point in my life. I am confident that my hard work and dedication will help me make the most of this opportunity and achieve my goals.

In life and work, I firmly believe that I have the ability to overcome difficulties and setbacks, and I also enjoy accepting challenges. I believe that this attitude is the key to my progress, and it is also the reason why I persist in life and work. I believe that as long as I firmly believe in myself and dare to face challenges, I can achieve success.
