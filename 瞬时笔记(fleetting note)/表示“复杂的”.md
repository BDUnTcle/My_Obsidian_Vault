Intricate things are complex and have many elements: they're not simple. Think of the intricate wiring of a computer's motherboard, or the intricate plot of a movie that you have a hard time following.
Anything intricate is complicated. Chess is a very intricate game that you could study your entire life and still not know everything about. On the other hand, a game like Connect Four is not very intricate. The more details and parts something has, the more intricate it is. A two-part plan isn't very intricate. A 2000-step plan is intricate; it's harder to wrap your head around.

When things get complicated, they are no longer simple and straightforward. If you are asked a question that would require a long, detailed answer, you might just say, "It's complicated."
The word _complicated_ came about in the 1640's to mean "tangled" or "difficult to unravel." This makes sense, considering it came from the Latin verb _complicāre_, meaning "to fold together." Consider that something with many folds is more complicated than something flat. Novelist Robert Ludlum said, "Life is extremely complicated," but Confucius long ago suggested that "Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated." Just having those two opposing viewpoints indicates how complicated life can be.

People who are really good at math can handle complex math problems. The rest of us are all set with simple stuff like the times tables. Use complex to refer to something that is not simple.
Something complex has two or more related parts, or is not simple in its structure. As a noun, a complex is a group of units, often a group of buildings. The adjective is stressed on the second syllable, but the noun is stressed on the first syllable. Complex is from Latin complexus, from complecti "to encircle or embrace."
