## scorn-[scorn](https://fanyi.baidu.com/#en/zh/scorn)

Scorn is open disrespect for someone or something. It can also be disrespect coupled with feelings of intense dislike.
The noun scorn describes your feelings of disdain when you encounter something you view as worthless or inferior — like, for instance, a talk show that gets all its facts wrong. Use the verb form for those times when you’re actively expressing scorn. You might scorn a politician who spends $100,000 on travel while claiming to work hard promoting middle-class values.

## contempt-[contempt](https://fanyi.baidu.com/#en/zh/contempt)

```
Reserve the noun contempt for an extreme lack of respect: a food snob has nothing but contempt for mass-produced burgers and fries at a fast-food joint.
Contempt has nothing to do with the verb condemn, despite the similarity in sound and meaning; it is from Latin temnere "to despise," and if you despise someone, you have contempt for them. It's a harsh term and should be used with care; it's stronger than either disdain or scorn. It suggests you find someone or something utterly worthless. That food snob might say the words "Big Mac" or "Whopper" with a voice dripping in contempt.
```
### 作为名词 n
- the feeling that sb/sth is without value and deserves no respect at all - 蔑视，轻蔑
- a lack of worry or fear about rules danger - （对规则，危险等的）藐视

## sardonic-[sardonic](https://fanyi.baidu.com/#en/zh/sardonic)

```
If someone is being scornful and mocking in a humorous way, call her sardonic. If you want to write comic sketches for late-night talk shows, work on being sardonic.
Sardonic comes from the Greek adjective Sardonios, which actually describes a plant from a place called Sardinia that supposedly made your face contort into a horrible grin...right before you died from its poison. The Greeks used sardonic for laughter, but we only use it when someone's humor is also mocking or ironic.
```
### 作为形容词 adj
- showing that you think that you are better than other people and do not take them seriously - 轻慢的，轻蔑地，嘲弄的 *symphony：mocking*
> a sardonic smile 讪笑

## satiric（satirical）-[satirical](https://fanyi.baidu.com/#en/zh/satirical)

```
If you know the movie you are about to see is satirical, you expect it to make fun some aspect of human nature or even our society, like a satirical take on the glamorous world of fashion that portrays all the designers as celebrity-obsessed and unconcerned with true artistry.
Satirical is an adjective that describes satire, a work that is intended to ridicule the shortcomings and antics of a person or group. So, something that is satirical often looks like the real thing in order to make fun of it. For example, a sketch on a comedy show in which a comedian sits behind a news anchor desk and uses a serious tone to "report" on absurd events that really happened takes a satirical approach to both the events and the concept of broadcast journalism.
```
### 作为形容词 adj
- using satire to criticize sb/sth - 讽刺的，讥讽的
> a satirical magazine 讽刺杂志
