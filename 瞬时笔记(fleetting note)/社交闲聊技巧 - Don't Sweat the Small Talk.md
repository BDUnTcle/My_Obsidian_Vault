# 简单总结（Summary）
- Many people dread small talks, and small talk usually be thought as less important or chit-chat when in fact, he says small talk is a wonderful way of connecting，bound ing，learning and growing.
- What makes small talk so challenging is the the fact that we can't have a script. We have to just go with what happens in the moment.
Two things that you should focus on：
1. how it flows
2. the experience from your experience
Your goal：to be interested，not interesting.

- slow down to think，and to give a appropriate responce
- using paraphrasing，which means you think what the others said and understand what they said
- consicion is almost always better in communication
- initiating with something that piques somebody’s curiosity，something that might be highlighting

*Spontaneous communication is about connection，not perfection.*
