# 表达
- 抱歉，我所表达的是您希望听到的吗？如果您觉得我有点跑题了，请随时出声纠正我。
	*Excuse me,  am I addressing what you asked for? Please feel free to crrect me at any time if you feel I am going off track.*
- 抱歉，我可能需要思考一下，整理下语言进而回答这个问题。
	*Sorry, I might need a moment to think and organize my thoughts before I answer that question.*

- 那时我的时间很紧迫，我挤出时间来准备托福考试。在此之前，我有超过 4 年时间没有接触英语相关的事情自从毕业后，包括读写和说英语。不过我仍然仅仅用了不到2 年时间就成功通过了申请。
	At that time, my schedule was incredibly tight, but I managed to carve out time to prepare for the application, including the TOEFL test and others. It had been over 4 years since I'd last engaged with anything related to English, including reading, writing and speaking, since I graduating. Despite this, I successfully pass the application process under 2 years.
- 只有在这里，我才能体验到最新的技术，我才能学到我真正想学的一些东西：知识，工作经验。世界的其他地方都没办法做到，就这里，硅谷。
	Its only here that I can immerse myself in the latest technologies and truly learn what I am eager to learn: knowledge, work experience. Nowhere else in the world can offer this--- it's just here, in Sillicon Valley.

- 就像我之前提到过的，chatGPT 的出现深深触动了我，也带我了解了生成式 AI 原来这么厉害。直至今日我也是 OpenAI 的忠实用户。所以我强烈希望能更深入地学习以及着手于相关的工作。我现在虽然只学习了一些皮毛的知识，实际项目经验也很弱，包括在课上学习的以及私下了解的。但是我认为这是未来的方向，如果有机会的话，我有信心将我的热情倾注在这一事业上。
	Like I mentioned before, the emergence of ChatGPT really resonated with me and opened my eyes to how powerful generative AI can be. To this day, I' m a loyal user of OpenAI. That's why I'm eager to dive deeper into learning and working in this field. Right now, I might only scrathed the surface with some basic knowledge and my practical experience is limited, including what I've learned in class and what I've explored on my own. But I see this as the direction of the future, and if given the chance, I'm confident I can dedicate my passion to this endeavor.

- 在回答这个问题前，我希望我能用几分钟的时间来介绍一下我来这里前的学术和工作背景细节

- 作为一名国际学生，我想知道我们在寻找工作时和本地学生有什么不同。哪些文件是我们需要的？我曾听说过 OPT 之类的。但是还是有很多没弄明白的地方。
## 自我经历介绍
老实说，自从我毕业参加工作直到现在，在对我而言重要的人生道路的分叉口前，我曾面临 2 次重要的选择。第一次是 2 年前，我第一份工作的老板找我谈话，他询问我愿不愿意离开当时的公司，加入他的新团队，在一家当时还未成立的 startup 公司担当软件开发。我思考一番后接受了他的邀请，不光是因为我和他私下交情不错，同时我认为这是对我能力的认可。第二次就是下定决心放弃当时各方面条件都不错的工作，来到这里学习新的知识和技术，以求跟上时代最新技术发展的脚步。我的第一和第二次正式工作的内容相似，都是以嵌入式主机上的软件开发为主，搭配安卓开发和使用 Qt 框架的 Windows 桌面应用程序开发。我主要负责代码的维护以及新功能模块的开发。一切的转机在 2022 年底，那时候我第一次听说了 chatGPT 这个新玩意，一开始我把它当做一个聊天机器人。但是短短一两周后它真正地在全球范围引起广泛讨论和关注的时候，我才意识到这是个多么了不起的玩意。我开始慢慢接触到什么是生成式 AI，什么是大语言模型，并且深深地被其吸引。于此同时我意识到这门技术一定是能决定未来科技走向的关键点。所以我当时就想能不能切身实地地在 cahtGPT 的诞生地，也就是这里---硅谷，学习和积累相关知识和经验。在这个想法的主导下，我花了 1 个月时间坚定了我的决心。然后我花了接近 2 年的时间使用工作业余的时间准备留学申请，最后我成功地站在了这里。这就是我 2019 年毕业后到现在接近 5 年的简要回顾。如今，我觉得我即将面临第三次的重要转折点，我十分感谢您能抽出时间来和我谈谈。我自认为我自己是一个机敏的人，我擅长把握事情的重点。不管是工作还是生活上，我也是一个把效率看得很重的人。在面对问题时我通常会寻找效率更高，更好的解决方法。性格方面我觉得我是一个很好相处的人。我不爱夸夸其谈，日常人际交往中我更愿意做一个聆听者。但是这并不代表我不善交往，我觉得这方面上我更像一个传统的中国人，谦逊以及有礼貌。我想让我的自我介绍听起来尽量简洁且高效，因此我省略了不少细节，包括我工作时期的具体项目经历以及在这边留学相关的内容。如果您想了解其中任何一项的内容，我很愿意继续花时间给您讲讲。
Honestly, since *graduating and starting my careeer*, I've faced *2 significant crossroads*. The first time came two years ago when my *first boss approached me about leaving the company to join his new venture*. He was starting a new startup that hadn't been launched yet. After some though, I accepted his offer. It wasn't just because we got along well privately. *I saw it as a recognition of my skills and competence.*
The second major decision was when I *decided to leave a pretty good job to move here* and *learn new skills and technologies* to *keep up with the latest advancements*. My work in my former two official jobs was similar, focusing on software development for embedded host, along with Android development and creating destop applications for Windows using the Qt framework. I *mainly handled code maintenance and new feature development*.
Then everything changed at the end of 2022 *when I first heard about ChatGPT*. Initially, *I thought of it as just another chatbot*. However, within a couple of weeks, as it began to gain global attention and sparked widespread discussion, *I realized its potential.* I became deeply interested in generative AI and LLMs. Realizing the pivotal role this technology could play in shaping future tech, I wanted to dive deep right at its brithplace,  Silicon Valley.
Driven by this idea, I spent a month firming up my decision, then nearly two years preparing for my studies in my spare time, and eventually, I make it here. This is a brief look back at my journey over nearly five years since my graduation in 2019. 
*Right now, I feel like I'm approaching another major turning point in my life, and I'm really grateful that you've taken the time to have this talk with me.*
I consider myself sharp and good at pinpointing the essence of matters, whether in work or life. I value efficiency highly and often seek the most effective solutions to problems.

Personality-wise, I think I'm easy to get along with. I'm not one to boast; I prefer to listen more in social interactions, but that doesn't mean I'm not good at communicating. In this regard, I'm more like a tranditional Chinese person---modest and polite. I want to keep this introduction brief and to the point, so I omitted details including specific projects I worked on and more about my studies here. I'd happy to share more if you are interested in any part of them.

这里我想稍微讲讲我的大学经历。尽管我的大学在国内排名不是顶尖的，但是我是我们那一届的佼佼者，尽管我明白考试分数和 GPA 不能决定一个学生是否真正的优秀，但是它还是给我带来了机会：学生在第一和第二个学年学习了基础学科后，可以凭借自己的意向选择深入学习计算机科学或者硬件相关的高级课程。这意味着我必须同时学一些软件和硬件的课程，像是模拟/数字电路基础这样的硬件基础课和数据结构和算法之类的 CS 基础课程。第三个学期，我选择了 CS 偏向，因为我发现比起电路或者 PCB 这些，我更喜欢代码，高级编程。然而这样的课程分配确实在我毕业后工作时帮助到了我。我的两份工作中，包含很多需要和硬件组协作的项目。像是 ARM 环境上的编程以及 FPGA 组进行交流之类的。我大一大二上的那些 EE 基础课帮助了我不少。我认为这是我能在前两份工作中快速升职的原因之一。
I'd like to share a bit about my college experience. Although my university wasn't top-ranked nationally, I was one of the standout students in my class. While I know that test scores and GPA don't define a student's worth, they did open doors for me: after spending the first 2 years on foundational subjects, students could choose to delve deeper into computer science or advanced electronic engineering courses based on their interests. This meant I had to take both software and hardware courses, from basics like Analog/Digital ircuits to core CS subjects like Data Structures and Algorithms.
In my third year of college, I opted for a CS track because I found that I preferred coding and advanced programming over working with circuits or PCBs. This course selection turned out to be immensely helpful when I started working. Both of my jobs involved projects that required collaboration with hardware teams, like programming in the ARM environment and interfacing with FPGA groups. The EE courses I took during my first 2 years really came in handy. I believe this foundation is one of the lessons I was able to advance quickly in my first 2 jobs. That's also one of the reason why I choose Data Science as my Master program. I am always open to exploring new things. Once I learn a new technology, I try to make it a point to use it when solving problems.
## 工作经历
我毕业以后的第一份工作，是在一个激光雷达制造公司担任软件开发的职位。我在那家公司干了 2 年，期间，我的工作覆盖了不少方面。一开始作为组里的新成员，我主要负责旧代码的维护和修补。那是一个运行在嵌入式系统主机上的服务程序，通过和 FPGA 模块以 RPC 的模式通讯从而达到控制激光雷达设备的功能。大概工作 1 年左右，我以主要开发人员的身份加入了新成立的项目小组。这个项目是公司的一个预研项目，当时他们正在研发一款新的轻便小型激光雷达，用于搭载在无人机上使用。那时候公司看中了大疆的无人机，并且想让我们的软件适配其 SDK 从而开发一款新软件实现同时操控我们的雷达以及大疆的无人机的功能。我作为主要开发人员，主要负责将大疆的 SDK 集成到我们的原有软件里，这涉及到框架代码的重构以及新模块的开发。同时，因为之前的客户端是 Windows 平台上的有线操控模式，公司还希望开发一套新的，在移动端设备上使用的客户端软件，用于远距离无线操控。这时由于公司当时人手不足，就让我来先接手移动段 Android 应用的框架建设。我当时临危受命，接下了这个担子。其实我当时没有实际的 Android 开发经验。只有大学时上过一门相关选修课，虽然我感受到压力，但是人物这是一个很好地锻炼自己能力的机会于是就接了下来。之后直到大概 2 个月后，公司才招了一个 Android 开发的新同事来接替这份开发工作。那时基本的框架已经搭建完成，之后那位新同事便主要负责移动端的开发。在这个项目期间，由于传输方式从有线改为了无线，传输带宽缩小所带来的问题就暴露出来。我因此被要求去解决这个问题，最后我通过重构 RPC 传输协议包框架，缩减包头统一字段，以及优化通讯中的包发送逻辑等优化方法将传输带宽的需求大大降低。为公司的无线电台选型减少了千元的成本。
After I graduated, my first job was as a software developer at a LiDAR manufacturing company. I worked there for two years, and my role covered various aspects. As the newest member of the team, at first, I  was initially responsible for maintaining and fixing legacy code. The code framework was for a service program running on an embedded ARM platform with linux OS, which communiated with FPGA modules via RPC to control the LiDAR devices. About a year into my job, I joined a newly-formed project team. We were developing a new, compact LiDAR designed for drones. At the time, the company was interested in DJI drones and wanted our software to be compatible with their SDK to control both our LiDAR and the drones. As the main developer, my job was intergrate DJI's SDK into our existing software, which involved refactoring the framework code and developing new modules. Additionally, since our previous client was wired control mode on the Windows Platform, the company wanted to develop a new client software for mobile devices to enable remote control. Due to a staffing shortage, I was tasked with building the framework for the Android app. I had taken only one relevant elective course in collge and had no actual Android development experience, but I tool on the challenge because it was a great opportunity to sharpen my skills. About two months later, a new colleague with Andriod development expertise was hired to continue the development. By then, I had laid the 30% of the foundation for the app framework.
During this project, we switched from wired to wireless transmission, which presented bandwitdh issues. I was tasked again with solving these problems and managed to significantly reduce our bandwidth needs by optimizing the RPC transmission packet framework, shrinking packet headers, and improving the logic of packet transmissions. This reduction in bandwidth requirements saved the company thousands Chinese yuan in radio transmission cost per unit.

我刚才也有提到，我的第二份工作，是跟着原公司老板成立的新开发组跳槽到了他的新 startup 里。那时，原公司面临着不少方面的压力，首先，原来那家公司是一个大公司的全资子公司，其母公司成立初是做光缆生产相关的生意。由于那几年资金压力，母公司管理层做了缩减子公司预算和停止新项目开发的选择。这才导致了我们公司老板独立创业的想法。所以在我来到新公司后，我的工作内容其实和在前一个公司时没有太大差别。基本是继续当时未完成的机载预研项目开发。在第二家公司任职的一年间，我还另外参加了新的项目组，负责开发 Windows 桌面端的一些软件，其中功能包括读取 Linux ext 文件格式，实时解析和显示激光雷达采集的点云数据等。不过因为我中途离开了公司，所以后者其实我并没有接触很久
I also mentioned earlier, that my second job was with a new startup founded by my former boss. The original company, a fully-owned subsidiary of a major corporation that started in fiber optics manufacturing, was facing financial pressures. This led to budget cuts and halted new projects, promting my boss to start his own venture. My role in the new company was very similar to my previous position, continuing with the airborne project I had been working on. During my year at this second company, I also joined a new team and developed some Windows desttop software that included deatures like reading Linux ext file formats and real-time parsing and displaying of LiDAR-collected point cloud data. However, I left the company mid-project, so I did not spend much time on this later task. 

我是在招聘平台 Handshake 上的校园招聘区看到的消息，一位应用数据科学的教授贴出了 research assistant 的招人需求。根据他的描述，他想招点人来协助他在多种 foundation 模型上的研究，包括 LLMs，XAI，Deep NLP 等。看到这则招聘信息，我立刻意识到这是一个绝佳的机会，如果我能争取到这个机会，为我自己在 AI 大模型的学习和实践上都有很大帮助。于是我并提交了简历申请。之后，我在花时间在学校网站找到他的联系方式想办法拜访了这位 Pendyala 教授，他人很好，在了解了我的相关背景后，他觉得我还没有达到他的要求标准。同时，他也没有太多的预算来招过多的助手职位。只是这个机会对于我来说实在是太难得可贵了，我不想轻易地放弃。我和他表示我可以做志愿工作，不需要工资，以及开始我可以不参与复杂的内容，如果可以，我愿意从简单的文书工作做起的想法。最后，他同意了我的申请，不过具体的工作内容等到开学后再讨论。

I found out about the position on Handshake, in the campus recruitment section. A professor in Applied Data Science had posted a need for a research assistant to help with research on various foundation models, including LLMs, XAI and Deep DLP. When I saw the positing, I immediately knew it was an excellent opportunity that could significantly benefit my learning and practical experience in AI's large models, so I submitted my resume.

Later, I took some time to find the Professor's contact information on the schools's website and managed to visit him. He's a great person and after hearing about my background, he felt I didn't quite meet his criteria yet. He also mentioned that his budget was limited and couldn't support many assistant positions. But this opportunity was too valuable for me to give up easily. I offered to work voluntarily, without pay and suggested starting with simple tasks if necessary. In the end, he agreed to my proposal, but we decided to discuss the specific tasks after the semester begins.
