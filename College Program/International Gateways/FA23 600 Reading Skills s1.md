# About the "Article Blog"

The _Article Blog_ assignment is to provide you more opportunities to read in English at an advanced level and to help you improve your reading fluency. You will complete one blog each week, so please make sure you complete your blog before 1:00 each Tuesday. You will have to briefly share your article in class each week. Below are some basic guidelines that you should follow when completing your blog. You can submit your blog on Canvas each week by either uploading a file or typing directly into the text box provided for each week's article blog assignment.  Include the following information for each post:

1.  **The title of the article** you read; the author's name; the name of the source where you got the article (newspaper, etc); and a link to the article (if you read it online) so that your classmates and I can find it ourselves if we would also like to read it. (If you read something that was not online, please provide all the pertinent information that we might need to find and read the article.)   

2. Provide a basic **summary** of the article. Please make sure you follow the opening sentence structure of a proper academic summary (name of author, name of article, appropriate reporting verb, main idea). Focus on big ideas and avoid details.  Refer to the author a couple of times (use his/her last name or pronoun (he/she) or "the author").  Use signal words to help with organization (then, next, also, towards the end).  Avoid personal opinions or suggestions.  The summary should be around **5** **sentences long**.

3. Your **general thoughts** about the reading, both the content and your experience of reading it: Did you enjoy it? Was it interesting? Dull? Challenging? Why? Did it connect to your personal life on any level? How? Imagine that you're having a conversation with the rest of the class about this article. Would you recommend we read it? Why or why not? Was there an interesting sentence or quote from the article that you'd like to mention to the class?  Basically, you need to share your feelings about the article in this section.  This should be about **5-7 sentences long**.

4. **Analysis** of some aspect of the article, for example: Is the author's tone persuasive to you? Is the style appropriate? Do you have any criticisms of the organization or the author's argument or the logic of what he/she is saying? You should not write about what you liked or disliked, rather you should focus on what the author did or did not do effectively.  This should be about **3-5 sentences long.**

 5. **Vocabulary notes**: What new words did you learn? Or, what new information did you learn about the usage of words you were already familiar with? Any new idioms or expressions? Any language you still don't quite understand? You should choose at least **3 new words, phrases or idioms** to discuss and explain. 

**_REMINDER:_ It would be wise for you to make sure you choose to read a variety of articles covering topics related to the areas and disciplines that TOEFL, GMAT and/or GRE reading passages cover: _social sciences, physical/biological sciences, humanities,_  and _business_.**
