### Timed Writing ：Compare and contrast spoken, conversational English and academic written English. Include at least 1 difference and 1 similarity. Use specific examples.

Have you ever got troubles in your language use during the daily communication and academic writting? For example, you meet your friends in the morning and say "Sincerly" then you friends just watch at you and say "Hey buddy, are you ok?" or you get a low score because you have so many words like "sucks" in your essay? Actually, written and spoken English use have many differences such as word use,abbrivation. However, there also many similarities like grammar, punctuation or pauses.
In spoken English, people usually tend to use much simple, causual and easy understandable  words and phrases like "good", "bad" "strange",but in academic written English they use advanced words such as "terrific","eccentric". 
On the other hand, there also many points that both written and oral English are followed in grammar and punctuations. For example you need to take care the tense both you write a essay and talk to another people other wise you will make they feel curious about your talk and write. You also need to make sure your use the correct puctuations on your passage and have a right pause when you talk.
So although there are various differences between written and spoken English, their similarities are also should be cared if you want to improve your proficiency in English. Have you ever made mistakes between the daily oral communication or academic written?
