## Body paragraph 1
single-used plastics have been causing many enviromental issues.
1. marine enviroment pollution
2. bad for ecosystems
## Body 2

## Body 3
some people may argue that people can not live without plastics in the mordern world.
It might be true because (some support of plastics used). 
However, it doesn't conflict to banning the single-used plastics since many technologies have make it easier for humans to replace those single-used plastics to more durable one.
By replacing single-use plastics to multiple-use, it could save more resources.

## Choosing effective keywords
**Choose words that communicate your main topic ideas**. The keywords you use for a search should clearly identify your research topic. Some words are unique to your topic and define important concepts from your topic. _Other words are general terms and can be used in just about any topic._

Let's say, for instance, that your research question is: **Does biology affect human behavior in a significant way?**

Two main categories of ideas emerge from this topic:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|||
|**Topic words**|**Related words**|
|**Biology**|genetics, genes, eugenics, nature, nurture|
|**Behavior**|personality, criminality, mental illness|

Notice that some of the words and phrases in this list (_biology_, _behavior_) came directly from the research topic while others (such as _genetics_, _genes_, _eugenics_, _nature_, _nurture_, _personality_, _criminality_, _mental illness_) are words that are related to the main idea.

Notice that these words are all **nouns;** they each name a person, place, idea or thing. Nouns make good keywords.

**Words to avoid**. The words _affect_ and _significant_ also appear in the topic, but they may not be effective keywords. They are too general and too common to be of much help as they appear in connection with a range of subjects, from biology to economics to fine art. _Role_ and _determining_ do not describe a main idea that is unique to your topic.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Avoid these kinds of words in Keyword searching**|   |
|**Affect**|**Change**|
|**Significant**|**Important**|
|**Way**|**??**|

**Start with a research question to help manage your own search or pull keywords/phrases from your working thesis and subtopics.** 

Example from a research question: Does fast food contribute to childhood obesity?  _Write your own research question.  List the topic words from the question and then develop a list of **at least three related words** for each topic word._ 

Example with words/phrases from working thesis: Fast food often contributes to childhood obesity. (sub-topics: high calories, child-targeted advertisements, poor food choices) 

Now, w_rite your own research question or working thesis. Then, list the topic words from the question or thesis. Last, add several **related words/phrases** for each topic word._ 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Topic words**|**Related words**|
|**deforestation**|forest clearance,wood industry (logging),agricultrue,urban industries|
|**developing countries**| Bangladesh,Brazil|
|**harm to ecosystems**|tropical rainforests(Amazon),wildfires,mining,climate change,habitat damage, biodiversity loss, and aridity|

_Remember to avoid overly general, common words such as ‘contribute’._

**Once you have developed a list of meaningful keywords, try a search**. Use the suggested terms areas in databases to help extend the search and skim articles to find other relevant keywords.

## Integrating Sources 

### **Integrating sources into "your" paragraphs**

Finding good sources isn’t the only difficult aspect of a research paper. You also need to integrate that source material into your paper. **Integration** means using the supporting material to support your ideas/claims. Source information is NOT meant to replace your words; it is meant to prove/develop/support your assertion, opinion, interpretation, etc.  

Therefore, you can’t simply “drop” quotes and statistics into your paragraphs and expect your readers to understand. Supporting material must be woven into the fabric of your paragraphs and essay/paper. To successfully accomplish this, you must make sure you fully understand your supporting material and be unfailingly honest about original ideas from sources. You cannot twist the writers’ words to fit your ideas. Then you need to build your paragraph using both your idea and the source information. 

**Whenever you use longer portions of* supporting material from sources, you can use these three sentences to help.**

1. **[Your claim] The first sentence introduces the main point (or sometimes sub-topic) of the section/paragraph. (The supporting material from the source will be used to support this idea). Often this is your topic sentence.**
2. **[Source Ref] The second sentence introduces and cites the source material.**
3. **[integration] The third sentence (or two) explains how the source material supports your claim [and often thesis, too], whether you agree or disagree with it, why it is important and/or relevant to your idea, etc. This is the part that most student writers execute poorly.**

Note: These 3 parts need not always be full sentences.  As well, some paragraphs may have more than one source included. Each paragraph is unique. Use these parts as guides to help with the integration process. 

- To ensure your “writer” ideas are clear to the audience, a body paragraph, ideally, should begin with **your idea** **stated as a topic sentence** rather than a paraphrase (or quote).
- Remember, the source information supports your paragraph-level writer claim (and thesis), so you need to explain to your readers how the source information, in a particular paragraph, supports your claim.
- Do not assume your readers understand the relevance of source material; integrate it!  
- A common shortfall of writers is to restate an already clearly stated paraphrase or quote instead of integrating the source (step 3).  

- If your paraphrase is clear, you don't need to restate it yet again. Be careful with phrases like "in order words" or "to be clear." 

Here are some examples of **successfully integrated paraphrases**. Identify the three parts of strong integration (claim, source, and connection). 

1. A) Peer pressure on young people has received a great deal of attention in the media lately, but the coverage seems to focus on the effects of peer pressure rather than how it originates. The arguments of anthropologist Clyde Kluckhorn (2004) offer an important clue; he explains that because culture constantly affects us, our behaviors are regulated by that culture throughout life. Though we are not always consciously aware, Kluckhorn continues, we behave based on exposure to other peoples’ behavior. Applying Kluckhorn’s explanation to peer pressure, it is easy to see that elementary and high schools are simply a microcosm (a small-scale example) of the larger society. Peer pressure reflects larger societal pressure to conform according to the prescribed behaviors most people follow.

1. B) College professors often complain that new students show only limited ability to think critically or creatively, yet this claim is unfair. According to Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Russell Baker, most children are socialized to take tests, not think critically, throughout the first twelve years of school. Baker explains, these children learn that success comes with repeating their teachers’ ideas onto tests. It seems illogical for professors to expect original or critical thought from first-year college students. As well, the emphasis on testing in primary and secondary education must be lessened and thinking independently taught and encouraged. When the early education system changes to teaching critical thinking, professors can increase expectations for original thought. Until then, professors should help students develop these skills.

[*for short phrases, terms, etc. this level of integration may not be needed].

IMPORTANT NOTE: When we integrate, we are not paraphrasing, again, the source idea. There is a common tendency to state, "In other words...." and then repeat the paraphrased idea. 

B) College professors often complain that new students show only limited ability to think critically or creatively, yet this claim is unfair. According to Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Russell Baker, most children are socialized to take tests, not think critically, throughout the first twelve years of school. Baker explains, these children learn that success comes with repeating their teachers’ ideas onto tests. _In other words, success comes from repeating their teachers' ideas._  

Avoid this! Paraphrase your source content well and clearly One time. Add the paraphrased information to your paragraph and then integrate that content into your overall paragraph idea and structure. Integrating well makes sure readers understand -very clearly- how the source information supports your idea. All the sentences in the paragraph should present a unified idea that includes source-based evidence.

### Integrating Multiple Sources in the same paragraph 

Yes! You can do this, too. Integration can explain how source content (from multiple authors) is similar or different, how one source seems to be correct while another seems not to be (hedge because you don't have all the research or the expertise).

Related to the topic of XX, there seems to be some disagreement about the actual cause of YY.  Source A (2019) explains that YY is caused by .......  Whereas Source B (2021) suggests that the main cause is ....  While both sources present alternate causes, the outcomes of both studies appear to be similar. For the purposes of this paper, the cause of YY is therefore less relevant than these very similar results. These similar results, that students experience stress while testing, support our claim that XX can ....

## Features of Good Academic Paragraph
- Clear topic sentence with a limited idea.
- keep the whole paragraph has a clear idea 
- Clear and coherence, sentence flow
	- use clear pronoun or repeate key words connected to your thesis. 
- Only use synonyms when you have 100% confident about it (Using "perfect" synonyms)
- Using source and evidence (FRIEDs)
	- keep "writer content" and "source content" clearly
- make your source well integrated in your paragraph when those sources or examples are not so obivious and connected to your TS
	- citation is used when you want to refer to something that is more  "academic". You don't need to cite others source to show a universal idea
