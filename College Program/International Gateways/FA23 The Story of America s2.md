# Washington and DuBois

**Booker T. Washington,** Introduction : An ex-slave, Washington believed that African Americans could better themselves and their situations through hard work. He believed in a non-confrontational policy. The speech described is called the "Atlanta Compromise" from 1895.  
  
Washington invites African Americans to "Cast down their bucket where they are" which means to accept their surroundings and realize that there will be continued struggle for equality. **On the last page (133)**, **first paragraph, fourth line from the bottom**, "No race can prosper until it learns that there is as much dignity in tilling a field as in writing a poem. It is at the bottom of life we must begin, and not at the top. Nor should we permit our grievances to overshadow opportunities."  
  
He continues on to say, **on the last page (133),  third line from the top of the second paragraph,** "...privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than artificial forcing. No race that has anything to contribute to the markets of the world is long in any degree **ostracized**."  
  
**W.E.B. Dubois**  
Dubois argued against Washington's theory of working hard from the bottom of society. Dubois was concerned that educational aid that had flowed to the South at the end of the war was diminishing due to the emergence of black codes and groups like the ***. Dubois refers to Washington as a "Negro" which represents backward thinking in Dubois' mind. **On the second page, (134) in the third line from the bottom of page,** Dubois states that "Mr.Washington's program practically accepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races."  
  
**On the third page, (135)**, Dubois remarks that Washington's plan asks black people to give up: political power, the need for civil rights, and higher education which has caused: the disfranchisement (taking away) of rights for black people, the creation of a legal status of inferiority, and a decrease of aid for higher institutions.  
  
Dubois concludes that African Americans must strive for equality and quotes Thomas Jefferson's opening of the Declaration of Independence ("We hold these truths...that all men are created equal").

# Black Elk

In December of 1890, American cavalry troops were relocating a group of Lakota Indians to Wounded Knee. During the march, while attempting to disarm the Native Americans, confusion occurred when a deaf Lakota did not understand his instructions. Gunfire broke out and over half of the Lakota were killed along with their already ill leader, Big Foot. Black Elk was a witness to the event, and his story was written down in 1931.  
  
**Second page**-(first sentence) "It was now the end of the Moon of the Popping Trees, and I was twenty-seven years old." Black Elk describes how the Lakota emerge from their hiding places in the Badlands due to starvation. Once they encounter the American soldiers, they are led to Wounded Knee. The night before the massacre, Black Elk has a vision that something bad would happen and awakes to the sounds of gunshots.  
  
**Third page to last page**-Black Elk puts on his battle shirt, paints his face red, and rides (with others who join him) into battle. He has no gun, just a bow and arrow. In a **gulch**, the Lakota are running and hiding while being shot by the soldiers. Black Elk shoots his arrows but is not hit by any gunfire. Black Elk and the Lakota can not force the soldiers back, and the soldiers later march off with the survivors towards the Wounded Knee Reservation. After the battle, Black Elk remarked (fourth line from second to the last paragraph) "And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard. A people's dream died there. It was a beautiful dream. And I, to whom such a great vision was given in my youth-you see me now a pitiful old man who has done nothing, for the nation's hoop is broken and scattered. There is no center any longer, and the sacred tree is dead."
