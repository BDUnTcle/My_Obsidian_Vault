You can best reach me per email (martina.bremer@sjsu.edu) or through Canvas. I will do my best to get back to you within 24 hours (36 hours on weekends). You can also reach me and your classmates on Piazza to ask course-related questions and get timely feedback.
### Instructor: Dr. Martina Bremer
- **Email:** [martina.bremer@sjsu.edu](mailto:martina.bremer@sjsu.edu)
- **Office:** MH 318A
- **Phone:** 408 924 1396
#### Office Hours
Think of the office hours as free tutoring for homework problems and to catch up with class material. They are also an excellent opportunity to get to know your fellow class mates and your instructor. This semester, office hours will be mostly in-person and partially on zoom (to accommodate as many students as possible). Some office hours will be held in my office (MH 318A) for only the students in my classes. Other office hours will be held in the Math Help Lab (room TBD). The latter may be attended by any math students, but students in my classes will have first priority.

If you come to the office hours to ask questions on the homework problems, please come prepared. I expect that you have thoroughly read the problem and at least attempted to solve it yourself. For zoom office hours, it is most effective if you have the work you already did either scanned or in some other electronic format, so that you can show it to me. Please feel free to ask clarification questions anytime before or after class or on Piazza, as they may be of interest to other students.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Tuesday|9:30am - 10:15am|in person, MH 318A|
|Tuesday|12:00noon - 1:00pm|in person, Math Help Lab (MH 426)|
|Wednesday|10:00am - 12:00noon|on zoom|
|Thursday|9:30am - 10:15am|in person, MH 318A|
|Thursday|12:00noon - 1:00pm|in person, Math Help Lab (MH 426)|

In addition to the office hours listed above, I am also happy to answer any course related questions on Piazza. I am not the only person from whom you can get help with questions about this course. Please see the [Office Hour page](https://sjsu.instructure.com/courses/1585169/pages/office-hours) on Canvas for additional help opportunities

##  Course Materials
---
### Textbook
**Required:** Jay L. Devore, Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences. 6th - 9th editions ok. Students should have access to either a hard copy or an electronic version of the textbook. Reading will be assigned for every class. See the [schedule](https://sjsu.instructure.com/courses/1585169/pages/math161a-home-page) posted on the course home page to know which section(s) to read. Posted section numbers refer to the 9th edition of the text.
### Calculator
A scientific calculator is required for this class to work on your homework and for quizzes and exams. It should have functions such as exponential, logarithm, square roots, powers, factorials and binomial coefficients (look for a button labeled nCr or something similar).
### Gradescope
We will be using [gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/694619) for homework assignments. You will be turning in your homework electronically on gradescope, and the grader and I will provide feedback on your work also through gradecope. The best way to access gradescope is through Canvas. If you do not yet have a free gradescope account, please follow the instructions on the warm-up assignment to make one.

You have two options for how to turn in your homework:

1. You can write your answers on paper (make sure to put your name on each page of your work) and then use a scan app (see [technology page](https://sjsu.instructure.com/courses/1585169/pages/technology)) to scan each page. Upload your document(s) in pdf format to Gradescope.
2. You will receive one point of extra homework credit for each assignment that you choose to typeset in Latex. Include your name at the top of your file. Upload the pdf file of your typeset homework on Gradescope. You can find more information on how to install and use Latex [here.](https://sjsu.instructure.com/courses/1585169/pages/technology) 

Gradescope will ask you to indicate when you upload your work, where each problem can be found. Please help to keep the grader sane by providing this information. It does not matter which page you specify for the Latex extra credit problem.

You will be receive (per email) an annotated version of your homework (with grader comments, rubrics and points per problem part) from gradescope after your assignment is graded. If you think that an error has been made in grading your work and you wish to file a regrade request, you must do that (on gradescope) within three weeks (21 days) after receiving your feedback email. In your regrade request, please provide a detailed explanation of why you think you deserve more points. I reserve the right to regrade more than the problem part(s) for which the regrade was requested.
### Technology

You must have access to a computer and the internet in order to be able to participate in this course. To submit your homework you must either be willing to type up your work, or have access to a scanner (you can download free scanning apps on your phone, for instance “Adobe Scan” or “CamScanner”). Read more about the technology you will need for this course ad how to obtain it on the [“Technology”](https://sjsu.instructure.com/courses/1585169/pages/technology) page on Canvas.
##  Course Requirements and Assignments
---
### Assigned Reading

It is most efficient if students read the assigned sections of the textbook before the corresponding lecture. You can see on the [course schedule](https://sjsu.instructure.com/courses/1585169) on Canvas which section(s) to read before each class. Asking clarifying questions during class is more time-effective than reviewing material after class and asking clarifying questions later during office hours. We will be working on solving problems in class together and in student groups every day and you will get more out of these active learning activities if you have prepared by reading the book.

Please print out the lecture notes provided [on Canvas](https://sjsu.instructure.com/courses/1585169) (or bring an electronic copy on a tablet on which you can annotate) and have them in front of you in class. When we work out examples and proofs together during class the intent is for you to take notes directly on your print-outs or electronic files. Math 161A is a 3-unit course. To be successful in this course, you are expected to spend a minimum of about nine (9) hours per week for this course on reading, studying, attending lectures and working on homework assignments.
### Videos
To increase the amount of time we can spend on active learning in class (working on problems together or in small groups) some of the lecture material has been moved to short (usually ~10-15min) videos. You can find these videos on Panopto or on the [Canvas course page](https://sjsu.instructure.com/courses/1585169).

Please watch the videos before class.
### Homework
Homework problems will be posted once weekly on Canvas (click on the [homework page](https://sjsu.instructure.com/courses/1585169/pages/homework) link). It is your responsibility to check the homework page on Canvas regularly and obtain new assignments. Your homework will be collected once a week, usually at 10:00pm on Thursdays. Solutions will be automatically be posted on Canvas after the due date. After the solutions are posted, late homework will no longer be accepted. You will turn in your homework in pdf format (either as a typed up file - Latex preferred) or as a scan of your handwritten work on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/694619). Each homework is worth 20 points. Students who choose to type up their homework (and make it easier to read for the grader) will receive one point (5%) of extra credit per assignment. Your lowest homework score will be dropped at the end of the semester. Total homework score at the end of the semester will not exceed 100%.

Most of the homework assignments will cover several sections of the textbook and notes. Work on the homework a little bit each day. Ask questions during the office hours, on Piazza, and before or after class. Do not wait until the day before an assignment is due to start work on it.
### Academic Honesty
Collaborative work is valuable and I encourage you to work together with others to discuss class materials and work on homework problems. Collaborative work means working together, discussing ideas, and even specific problems. It means asking for and giving help. It does NOT mean copying. On any assignment, what you turn in must be, in the end, your own work. Copying an answer from someone you know or from the internet without understanding it is NOT collaboration, it's cheating.

Posting homework, quiz or exam questions or instructor provided solutions to "homework help" websites such as Course Hero is a violation of university policy and constitutes copyright infringement. If you are not sure about whether an activity is cheating or an intellectual property violation, feel free to ask me.
### Poll Questions
During class, you will be asked to respond to low-stakes poll questions using the PollEverywhere polling system (see [technology page](https://sjsu.instructure.com/courses/1585169/pages/technology) on Canvas). Each response will earn you 1 point, whereas a correct response will earn you 3 points. The questions will be on the content covered in the previous and the current lecture and are intended to provide all of us immediate feedback on how well the current topics are understood.

**Extra credit for in-class polls:** Every student will start off with 10 extra credit points for their "In-Class-Quiz-Polls" to allow for an occasional missed class or technology troubles. In addition, we will regularly be working in class on solving problems in small groups. I will ask for student volunteers to present their solutions to the rest of the class. Any student who presents and posts their group's written solution to Canvas will receive three extra points of in-class poll credit per problem presented. Total in-class poll score will not exceed 100%. In-class poll quizzes will count as 5% of your final scores.
### Quizzes

Consider the occasional quizzes that we'll have in class as a low-stakes rehearsal for your midterm exams. The format, and questions your will see on quizzes will be similar to the format and questions you will find on your midterm exams. Quizzes are timed and will take place usually at the end of class (last ~10-15 min). Quizzes are closed-notes and closed book, but you may bring an index card full of notes to each quiz. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped at the end of the semester. Quizzes will count 5% towards your final scores.
### Exams

There will be two exams (midterms) and a cumulative final exam at the end of the semester. See [course schedule](https://sjsu.instructure.com/courses/1585169/pages/math161a-home-page) on Canvas for exam dates and review materials. These will be closed book/closed notes exams. You are allowed to bring a calculator and one page of cheat sheet (8.5” × 11”, handwritten in your handwriting, no photo copies, you may write on both sides) to the midterms and two pages of cheat sheet to the final. Additional resources or electronic communication devices are not allowed during the exams.

The final exam is scheduled for the following day and time:

- Section 3: Thursday, 5/16/24, 9:45am - 11:45am  
- Section 4: Friday 5/17/24, 12:15pm - 2:15pm

If you are unable to attend an exam due to illness or emergency, you must contact your instructor (by e-mail) no later than 24 hours after the exam was administered in order to be eligible for a make-up exam.
### Project

Towards the end of the semester you will be assigned a writing project will require you to put what you have learned so far into practice. You will have two weeks (14 days) to work on the project. Students are expected to work independently on this project and turn in a well thought out, organized and well phrased (spell-checked) solution. You will be required to carry out probability computations, make informed decisions using your probability knowledge, and justify those decisions in paragraph form. Solutions must be typewritten and are usually between three to five pages long. Detailed instructions for the project will be posted on the course home page later in the semester. The project will count 5% towards your final course grade.
##  Grading Information
---
Final grades for this course will be determined using the following weights:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Homework|25%|
|Poll Questions|5%|
|Quizzes|5%|
|Project|5%|
|Midterm I|20%|
|Midterm II|20%|
|Final Exam|20%|
|Total|100%|

Your homework, poll, quiz, project and exam scores will be posted on Canvas. You should check Canvas often to make sure that the posted scores are correct.  At the end of the semester, your lowest homework and quiz score, respectively, will be dropped.

Letter grades will be determined from your final scores using the following cutoffs:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|A+|[97,100]|
|A|[93,97)|
|A-|[90,93)|
|B+|[87,90)|
|B|[83,87)|
|B-|[80,83)|
|C+|[77,80)|
|C|[73,77)|
|C-|[70,73)|
|D+|[67,70)|
|D|[63,67)|
|D-|[60,63)|
|F|[0,60)|

**Example:** If your final score at the end of the semester is 86.9, then your final grade is a B.

**Extra Credit Opportunities:** There are three ways to obtain extra credit in this course. 

1. If you choose to type up your homework instead of handwriting and scanning it to make it easier to read for the grader, you can obtain 5% extra homework credit per typed up assignment set.
2. Every student will start off with 10 extra credit points for Poll Questions (to allow for the occasional missed class or for technology issues).
3. If you volunteer to present the solutions to problems you worked on during group work to the class, you can obtain 3 points of extra poll credit per presented solution.

Beyond these three extra credit opportunities described above, there won't be any other extra credit opportunities in this course. In particular, there are no extra credit opportunities after the last day of class. Please plan accordingly.

**Disclaimer:** You should be able to see your grade totals in each category on Canvas as well as a weighted “total”. Please note that the weighted “total” that Canvas computes at any time during the course is not necessarily an accurate reflection of your current grade in the course (due to the way that Canvas counts or ignores missing and future assignments). If you would like to have a better idea about what your final grade will be, use the spreadsheet instead that is posted at the top of the course home page. Your poll scores will be updated on Canvas occasionally, but not after every class. Check the PollEverywhere site to see your current poll score.
