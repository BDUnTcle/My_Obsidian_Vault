# In-Class Problems

1. construct the domination graph for all students
2. Find the longest path including you
3. On reverse path, find the longest path from you to start

How to find the number of path in a graph from start to end？
Cal all number of path from u to v in topological order (same as SSSP in DAG but the initial weight is 1)
