## Independence
### Definition
![[Pasted image 20240224091205.png|]]
### Independence and mutually exclusive
> Mutually exclusive != independence

**The only way to identify that whether event A and B are independent or not is** : $P(A \cap B)= P(A)P(B)$
> And If A, B are independent, then:
> A and $B^\prime$, $A^\prime$ and B, $A^\prime$ and $B^\prime$ are also independent
