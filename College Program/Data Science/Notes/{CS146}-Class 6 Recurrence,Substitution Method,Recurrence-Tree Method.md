# In-Class Problems
- *recursive case*: problem or subproblem are large enough to solve recursively
- *bottoms out*: problem or subproblem become small enough that we no longer recurse

### Recurrences
-  what is *recurrences* ?
	 A: a recurrences is an equation or inequality that describes a function in terms of its value on small inputs.

### The Substitution Method
### 2 steps
1. Guess the form of the solution.
2. Use mathematical induction to find the constants and show that the solution works.

#### What a bad guess neams?
Nothing
### The Recursion-Tree Method
*A recursion-tree is best used to generate a good guess*

### Find a algorithm about function“isGreater (x, k)”
IsGreater (x, k) return are there at least k values in a max-heap such that >= x
