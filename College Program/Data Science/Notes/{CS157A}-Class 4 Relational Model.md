# In-Class Problems
## The Relational Model
A relation consists of
1. Relation schema (structure): relation's name, name of each field(column)/attribute, domain of each field'
2. Relation Instance: set of tuples which has the same number of fields as the schema

- Integrity Constraints
	- Primary Key Constraints: 
		- No 2 distinct tuples can have same values *in all key fields*(but primary key may be compositive)
		- Primary Key can not be Null
	- Domain Key Constraints
	- Foreign Key Constraints
