## Basic Principles of a Cover Letter
- Don't send a "general" cover letter (always write a new one tailored to the job you are applying for)
- Don't just repeat information on your resume in the letter
- Don't write too formally (or too informally)
- Do demonstrate:
	- You know what the job entails
	- You meet the requirements of the job
	- You have relevant experience

## Documental Format
- The font is important (Arial, Calibri, Times New Romance... font size: 11~12, double spaced, margin: 1 inch)
