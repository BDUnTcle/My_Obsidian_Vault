# In-Class Problems
the meaning of "reduction":
1. Given: Clique is NP-Hard
2. Clique reduces to Independent Set
LIS->LCS: (reduce new problem A to a known problem B means B is not much easier than A)
1. Copy the sequence into a new sequence
2. Sort the copy
3. Find LCS between the 2 sequence

NP-hard: a statement of difficulty
NP: a statement of easy
