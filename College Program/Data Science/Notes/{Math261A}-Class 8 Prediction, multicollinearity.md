## Multicollinearity
**Multicollinearity** is the {{prevalence of near-linear dependence}} among the {{predictor variables}} .

### Variance Inflation Factors (VIF)
The {{**main diagonal elements of the inverse of the predictor correlation matrix**}}  are called the variance inflation factors (VIF), The {{larger}} these factors are, the {{more}} you should worry about multicollinearity in model.
