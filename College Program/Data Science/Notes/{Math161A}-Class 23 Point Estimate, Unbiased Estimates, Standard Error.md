# Review List
>[! abstract] Main Topics
>1. What is "**Point Estimate**" and its normal steps (3 steps)
>	1. State population and parameter (mean, proportion)
>	2. Take a sample $X_1,...,X_i$
>	3. Compute a statistic $\hat{\mu}=\overline{X}$ 
>2. What is "**Unbiased Estimators**"
>3. What is "**Estimators with Minimum Variance**"
>4. What is "**Standard Error**"

>[!tldr] important Notations
>1. θ and $\hat{\theta}$ in point estimate
>> $\theta$ is the real parameter we care about to a population, usually to be **proportion**, **mean** or **variance**
>> $\hat{\theta}$ is based on experiment and different sample. Its a calculated statistics
>> We always try to use $\hat{\theta}$ to *estimate* the real $\theta$

# In-Class Problems
>[!tip] The goal of statistics is to use data to draw conclusions about populations

## Point Estimate

Difference between "statistic" and "statistics"
A statistic is any function of sample

Unbiased doesn't means a "good" estimator
