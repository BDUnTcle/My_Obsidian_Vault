# Review List
>[! abstract] Main Topics
>1. Find the **least squares parameter estimates** of a simple linear regression model by minimizing the sum of squared residuals (using Calculus)
>2. Find the **estimated slope $\hat{\beta_{1}}$**, **intercept $\hat{\beta}_{0}$** and **residual variance $MS_{Res}$** in an application, given data summaries
>3. Read estimated slope, intercept and residual variance from R output
>4. Be able to show that the least squares estimates of the slope and intercept are unbiased and derive their variance
>5. Understand what MSRes represents and how to estimate it from data summaries
>6. Conduct hypothesis tests for the model parameters by-hand given data summaries. Read the results of hypothesis tests on the model parameters from R output.
>7. Construct confidence intervals for the model parameters by-hand from data summaries or read the result from R output
>8. Find probabilities and quantiles for common distributions (t, Normal, F, 2 ) either from printed tables or using your calculators
>9. Read and interpret ANOVA tables for simple linear regression problems
>10. Construct condence interval for the residual variance from data sum maries
>11. Find condence interval for the mean response at given predictor level
>12. Find prediction interval for a new observation at a given predictor level
>13. Apply above concepts to different models (for instance models without intercept)

# In-Class Problems

Excuse me for posting a extra text here. I'm looking for a group to join for the project.  So please contact me if there is an available spot of your group for me to join.
