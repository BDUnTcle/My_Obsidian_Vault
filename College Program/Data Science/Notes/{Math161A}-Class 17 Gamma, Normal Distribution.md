# In-Class Problems
## Gamma Distribution
>[!tip] Compare **Gamma** with **distribute Negative Binomial**
> They all describe such a RV: waiting for the $r^{th}$ event
>> [!example] Examples
>> 1. Time until the r-th customer enters a bank
>> 2. Mileage that you get out of r tanks of gas

### Definitions
>[!note] PDF of Gamma ($\lambda,r$)

>>> [!note] $\Gamma(\alpha)$ is the Gamma function defined as
>>> ![[Pasted image 20240321184423.png|600]]
>>>>[!tip] For a positive integer n, $\Gamma(n)=(n-1)!$

## Normal Distribution
### Definitions
![[Pasted image 20240321185236.png]]
### Remarks
- $E(X)=\mu$
- $V (X)=\sigma^2$
- The median is equal to the mean
### Standard Normal and notations
>[!important] A normal random variable with mean $\mu=0$ and variance $\sigma^2=1$ is called Standard Normal random variable
