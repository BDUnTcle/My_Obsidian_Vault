# In-Class Problems
## 1. CI for Large Samples
![[Pasted image 20240516201045.png]]
**条件**：
1. Sample size n is large (n>40)
2. Population mean $\mu$ is known
3. Population variance $\sigma^2$ is unknown
4. Population Distribution doesn't matter

## 2. CI  for Population Proportion

![[Pasted image 20240516201650.png]]
**条件**：
1. We know the proportion in a experiment 
## 3. CI for Normal Populations and t-distribution
### T-distribution

**条件**：
1. Population must to be Normal distributed
2. Known sample mean and sample standard deviation
