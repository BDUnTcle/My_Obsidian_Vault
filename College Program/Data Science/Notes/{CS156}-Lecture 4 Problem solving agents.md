# In-Class Problems
## Problem-Solving Agents
### Offline/simple problem solving agent
![[Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach (3rd Edition).pdf#page=86&rect=147,499,554,698|Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach (3rd Edition), p.67]]
### Problem types
- Deterministic: agent knows which state it will be in
- Non-observable: agent may have no idea  where it is
- Nondeterministic: 
- Unknown state space
### Problem formulation
