## Publisher-Subscriber
An <u>object that fires an event</u> is called a *publisher*. Examples of events include state changes, time-outs, and user inputs
Other objects, called *subscribers*, may <u>need to be informed when such events occur</u>
For example, when the value of a spreadsheet cell changes, other cells may need to update their values. In this example cells are both publishers and subscribers. But we want to be able to add and remove subscribers without having to modify the publisher's code and we want to avoid forcing the subscribers from having to constantly poll the publisher for events.
