## Lecture 6-2
>[!abstract] AI vs ML vs DL
>>[!question] What is AI?
>>- The science and engineering of creating intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.
>>- Any technique that mimics human behavior
>
>> **Objective**: Mimic human intelligence - reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, etc.
>> **Examples**: Robotics, Natural Language Processors, Expert Systems.
> 
>> [!question] What is ML?
>> - A subset of AI that provides machines the ability to learn automatically & improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
>> - Any technique that learns from experience
>
>>**Objective**: Predict outcomes and adjust actions accordingly
>>**Examples**: Email filtering, Speech Recognition, Recommendation Systems
### Machine Learning Algorithms
