# Review List
>[! abstract] Main Topics
>1. Statistics is a Science for what? (3 aspects)
>2. Characteristics of **histogram** (peaks, x, y axis representative, unimodal, bimodal, positively negatively skewed)
>3. Differences between **bar graph** and histogram
>4. 4 point in **boxplots**
>5. **Sample mean**, **sample median** **sample variance** and **sample standard deviation**
>	1. How to calculate the sample mean $\overline{x}$ (arithmetic average)
>	2. How to calculate the sample median $\tilde{x}$ (2 cases)
>	3. How to calculate the sample variance $s$

- Know how to get information through a histogram
	- X，Y axis
	- How to get *Mean* from a histogram?（the sum of midpoint of each bin times frequency of each bin then divided by total frequency）
	- How to get *Variance* from a histogram?（）
	- How to get *Approximate Percentage* from a histogram ($\frac{Frequency of the inteval}{total observation}$)

# In-Class Problems
Statistics is a science of **collecting**, **presenting** and **interpreting** data
- Population
- Sample
- Census
- Variable
## Quantitative , Categorical and Bi (Multi) Variate

## Graphical ways to describe data
### Histogram
- X-axis marks the possible values of the variable
- Y-axis shows the observed frequencies of the values

### Bar Graph
>exclusively for categorical data, use to display frequency of occurrences of possible values

>[!question] What are the differences between bar graph and histogram
>>- A bar graph is used to display **non-numerical categorical data** and a histogram is used to display **quantitative data**
>>- In histograms, the values on the x-axis have to be in **order**. Bar graphs can have the categories listed on the x-axis in any order.
>>- The **intervals** of a histogram should cover the whole range with a sensibly Chosen number of classes. Bar graphs need to have as many bars as there are Categories.

### Boxplots

## Numerical ways to describe data
### Sample mean, Sample median and Trimmed Mean
>[!note] Sample mean is the arithmetic average of the observations
![[Pasted image 20240416154246.png|1000]]

>[!note] Sample Median is the "middle" observation
>The median divides the data set into two parts of equal size
> ![[Pasted Image 20240501091030_172.png|1000]]

>[!note] Trimmed Mean
>The median divides the data set into two parts of equal size
> ![[Pasted image 20240501092356.png|1000]]
### **Variability(Sample Variance)**
