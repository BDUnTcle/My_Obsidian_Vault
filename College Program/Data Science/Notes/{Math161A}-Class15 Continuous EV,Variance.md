# Flash Cards
**3 special call of percentile**
???
1. Median (50%)
2. The first quarter (25 %)
3. The third quarter (75%)
<!--SR:!2024-05-28,42,250-->

**EV(Expected Value)  and Variance of X in Continuous RV is :**
???
$\mu x=E(X)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} xf(x)dx$
$E(X^2)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x^2f(x)dx$
$V(X)=E(X^2)-E(X)^2$
