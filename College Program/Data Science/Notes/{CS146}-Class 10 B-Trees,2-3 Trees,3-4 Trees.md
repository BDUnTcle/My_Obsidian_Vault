# In-Class Problems
## Problems
### 1. Continuing the Scanning Algorithm (silowete siloverte problem)
#### Increasement approach
Using balanced binary search tree to stroe
From the lowest building to highest building
Each time you always add 4 more points

#### Divide-and-conquer technical
1. Divide by original
2. Divide by height
	1. Sort by height 1 st
3. Divide by x coord
	1. Sort by x 1 st

all those algorithms above takes $nlg^n$
