>[!note] Examples：
>1. The number of hurricane in the U.S. in a month
>2. The number of misprints on a page of some document

>[!question] how to define and understand *interval*，*subinterval* and the $\lambda$
>> [!hint]
>> A Binomial situation when n-> $\infty$
>> The $\lambda$ =E (X) , which is the mean of X

Example of hurrican.
