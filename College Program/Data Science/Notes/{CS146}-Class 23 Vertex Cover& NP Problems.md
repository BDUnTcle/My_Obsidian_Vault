N Approximation Algorithm: a algorithm cost <= N* cost

## Hamiltonion Cycle (all vertices are in the cycle) The Traveling Salesment Problems
- In a Graph, is there Ham cycle exist?
- Given a graph, is there a H.C. of cost<=k?

## The Metric Space
### Definition
1. For all x, dist (x, x)=0
2. For all x, y dist (x, y)=dis (y, x)
3. For all x, y, z dist (x, y)+dist(y, z)=dist (x, z)
>[!tip] Steps of one 2 approximation algorithm
>>- Find the minimum spanning tree, the cost MST <= cost optimal TS cycle
>>- Travel MST once in each direction-> costs <= 2 OPT of TS cycle
>>- add shortcuts to make it cost smaller when back to the previous vertices
