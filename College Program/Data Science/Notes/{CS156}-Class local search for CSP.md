> Local search algorithms 
## Min-Conflicts
Use heuristic that select the value which results in the minimum number of conflicts with other variables
## Constraint weighting
![[Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach (3rd Edition).pdf#page=241&rect=120,499,527,592&color=red|Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach (3rd Edition), p.222]]
- Each constraint is given a numeric weight $W_{i}$, initially all 1
- At each step of the search, the algorithm choose a variable/value pair to change that will result in the lowest total weight of all violated constraints
## The structure of problems
- @ Independent subproblems
	- Identified by finding **connected components**
### Tree structured CSP
