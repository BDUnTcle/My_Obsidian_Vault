# In-Class Problems
Different level for algorithms and data structures
1. API Level
	1. Know what the algorithm or data structure is, how many methods it has and what those methods accomplish, maybe know runtime and space requirement for them. 
2. Know how it works and accomplishes
3. Know how to model practical problem to match algorithm we already know

>[!tip] **Transform problem** compares **transform algorithm accomplishment**
- If we have a well written, good algorithm for a similar situation, we can try to modify it to fit the current problem.
	- For this problem, we want to detect are there product of weight in some cycles keep increasing
	- It is similar to detect negative cycles in some SSSP algorithm (eg. Bellman-Ford). So we just need to modify it for this problem.
- If we just have a black box of algorithm and we can't change the code, we can try to modify our problem to fit the general problem. 
	- For this problem, when we change the edge weight with logarithm
