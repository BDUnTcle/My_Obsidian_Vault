# In-Class Problems
## Expected Value Definition
>[!note] The Expected Value is used to describe a random variables
>We may interchangeably use the terms mean, average, expectation and
Expected value and the notations $E (X)$ or $\mu$ (for mean). The expected value is a
Weighted average of the possible values of X, weighted by the probabilities.

## EV Property

## Variance & Standard Deviation Definition 
![[Pasted image 20240224094449.png]]
**μ：E (X)**
- V (X) is always non-negative (V (X) >= 0).
- V (X) is a measure of the spread of the random variable. If V (X) = 0, then the spread is zero, i.e. all the probability is concentrated in one point (nothing random anymore).
- The variance is not measured in the same units that the random variable is measured in (disadvantage!)

# Review List
Use $\mu$ or mean to denote EV, $\sigma$ to denote standard deviation
1. $E(X)=\sum_{all x}xp(x)$
2. $V(X)=\sum\limits (x-\mu)^2p(x)=E(X^2)-E(X)^2$
3. $V (aX+b)=a^2 V (X)$
4. $E (aX+b)= aE (X)$
5. $E(X+Y)=E(X)+E(Y)$
>[!note] Special property of Variance
>> 1. V (X) >= 0
>> 2. The smaller variance is , the less spread of the RV are.
>> 3. The unit of variance
