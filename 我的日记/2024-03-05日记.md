By setting up the templater and many other plugin, I built a better diary and class note management framework in my Obsidian than before. Hopefully it could make my daily summary and organization work flow more organized. However, I forgot to do the daily summary in the evening before I went to bed because I dived into the CS 146 assignment which took me several hours. I think I need to spent at least 30 minute in it from tomorrow.


>[!Abstract] 知识整理 (Daily Organization)
>>1. 整理当日课程的笔记
