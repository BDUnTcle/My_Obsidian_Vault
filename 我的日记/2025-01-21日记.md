# Thoughts and epiphanies
我昨天和姑父讨论了一下实习开始的日子定在什么时候好的问题。我一开始的想法是，我春季学期预定月底结束，大概是
20 号考完试。秋季学期开始于八月 20 日。这期间正好有 12 周的间隔，用于实习。但是姑父则有他自己的一些想法。他心里设想的最好情况是：尽量借助这一次实习，争取到转正的机会。所以他觉得如果实习结束的太早，我之后还有一个学期的课程要上，那么一切都变得不确定了。他担心事情发生变故，比如说没有正式的位置或者被别人捷足先登等。所以他想能否尽量地让我的实习结束时间接近我的毕业时间，哪怕会影响学习和给我带来时间上的压力。甚至如果条件允许，把 12 周的实习时间拆分成两段来做。姑父当然站在他的角度上考虑了很多，我很感谢他。你的看法是怎样的呢？我想听听你的意见。

I discussed with uncle about when to start my internship yesterday. I initially thought it would work out since my spring semester ends around the May 20 th after final exams, and the fall starts on August 20 th. That gives me a 12-week window for the intern. But uncle has his own thoughts. He thinks the best scenario would be to use this intern as a stepping stone to secure a full-time position at Ambarella. So he's  concerned that if the internship ends too early in August and I still have a semester left, things gonna to be uncertain. He's worried about possible changes, like not having a position available or someone else taking the opportunity. So, he's wondering if we could align the end of my internship closer to my graduation date, enven if it will impact my studies and puts some time pressure on me. He also talked about ,if possible, splitting the 12-week into 2 seperate periods. Of course, I really appreciate that he's looking out for me from his perspective. But I also want to hear your opinion. What do you think? Do you think he makes a good point?
