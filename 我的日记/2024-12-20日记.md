# Thoughts and epiphanies
自我介绍：
	My name is Jiahao Tang. I was born and raised in a city called Huangshi. After graduating from the local high school, I attended Yangtze University, located in Jingzhou, to continue my studies. I spent 4 years there to get my Bachelor's degree. Then I found a job as a software engineer and worked for 3 years in Wuhan. During the time I was close to graduating, my grandfather's health began to deteriorate, and he required year-round hospitalization. Having by raised by my grandparents, I hold deep affection for them. When my grandmother passed away, I missed the chance to see her one last time, which only left me with endless sorrow at her funeral. Therefore, I decided to work in Wuhan, allowing me to return to Huangshi within 3 hours if anything happen, and avoid such regrets with my grandfather.
