**Fluency part 1**
其实预制菜没什么不好的。It's actually nothing wrong with pre-cooked dishes itself.
不如说在当今这个快节奏的世界里，预制菜的诞生存在着某种必然性。 It has certain inevitability for the coming of pre-cooked dish since we are in such a fast paste world.
但是随着近些年来越来越多被主流媒体曝光的预制菜生产厂商丑闻，预制菜这个词在人们心里也被贴上了"无良厂商"，"食品安全无保障"以及“低成本高利润”的一些标签。这导致了人们谈到预制菜而想到的不是它所带来的便利，而是更多的负面印象。这是我认为在互联网讨论里人人都谈“预”色变的主要原因。 However, with more and more scandal of pre-cooked dish's manufacturing being exposed by the media, the word "pre-cooked dish" has been labeled with "unresponsible manufacture", "no food safety secure" and "low cost high profit" etc. , which leads people usually to think about more negative image than it's convenience. That's the main reason that when there are a pre-cooked dish discussions on the Internet, everyone will shake their heads and sigh.

"It's actually not wrong with pre-cooked meals themselves. One could argue that in today's fast-paced world, the emergence of pre-cooked meals was somewhat inevitable. However, as scandals involving pre-cooked meal manufacturers have been increasingly exposed by mainstream media in recent years, the term 'pre-cooked meals' has become associated with 'unscrupulous manufacturers,' 'lack of food safety,' and 'low cost, high profit.' As a result, when people talk about pre-cooked meals, they often think of these negative connotations rather than the convenience they offer. This, I believe, is the main reason why discussions about pre-cooked meals on the internet often turn sour."
