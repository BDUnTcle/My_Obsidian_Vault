People feel different when they account theirself from others in the same situation.
In the professors example, he went to a store to buy sth one day.And he was cutted in 
line by others .He immedieatly thought the one is selfish and rude people.
However,in the other day,he went to store again and he was hurry because he was late 
for a important meeting.So when he saw a short line,he ran to get the line before other.
But he don't think he was rude or selfish this time for his reason and situation.
So pepole focus on person rather than situation, and people always aware of their own 
situation but don't know others. ^OrbIBf2H

According to the lecture , learning art impact a child by two ways:
first it provide a platform for their to express emotions Because chidren 
have limited vocabulary.
The example the professor gave is a girl can express her emotion like happiness

Like the example , a boy intend to moudle a clay into a car shape.At first he 
maybe dosen't complete it ,But after many times he could do it and he feel great
satisfied of his success.It can build his confidence and patient . ^u6rNNLvW
