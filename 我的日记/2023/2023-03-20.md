According to the statement , the university is going to add choir's off-campus singing competition next year.
In the conversation ,  the man think it's great .And he agree it with 2 reasons.
First, he think the off-campus activity can motivate the choir's members.He say now the choir do practice
once a week , doing more competition with other schools can help them perform better. 
Secondly , he think the off-campus activities can help the program.The university's program is small now.
So , if they can make more people to listen them singing and perform good, it may attract more people to attend
the university . And help the program. ^MEVKPRzO

The passage talk about "relict behavior" , which means animal's behaviors no longer 
serve a clean purpose now because of the changed condition of it' habitat.
The professor gives american pronghorn as a example.
He says that pronghorn is a very fast animal in the north american and other preditors
live in there can not catch them.And he gives the reason why pronghorn run so fast.
It's becaus lions used lived in the north american but now extinct.And lion is very swift
animal , faster than preditors today live in the pronghorn's habitat.In that time , in order
not to be preded the pronghorn developed to run fast. ^gdGuQfGG

According the professor's lecture, she gives two kind of ways that the characteristics
of target customers influence marketing strategy for products.
First is the age of target customers.She gives the example like if a sell company wants
to sell toy cars , their target customers are kids.So they may advertise in the tv during
time when kid will watch TV shows .So chirdren may ask their parent to buy the toy for them.
Second is geograph location target customers live.She says if company want to sell boat
they usually advertise near the ocean or lakes. because those people who live around
lakes or near the ocean are their target customers.It can improve the possibility of selling
the boats. ^JePWhlUv

In my opinion , I agree with the statement for 2 reasons.
First , the trend of globalization have became unresisted in today.
And it's better for us to learn about other cultures to adapt the global enviroment.
the other reason is it can help us to communication with others in a different
country .It's convenient to talk with people of multicultrue through the Internet.
So knowing more about other culture makes it easier for us to make friends with those
people in different cultures. ^WolNZcm7
