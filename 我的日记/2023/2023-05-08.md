more healthy
enjoy coking

save money
reduce expense in having meals ^hRs5Perm

I prefer to cook at home if I have the time.
Firstly cooking in home can reduce cost in having meals .If you go to restaurant every day , there is 
a great expense.
Secondly , cooking at home by oneself is more healthy way in daily life. You can use fresh and healthy ingredient you like
Finally 
,for people who like cooking , preparing meals in home is a enjoyed and relaxing period of time  ^bL4V6Sew
