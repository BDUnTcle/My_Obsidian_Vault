The article, ~~‘Return To The Moon’~~ "Return To The Moon", written by Lucia De Stefani, talks about the U.S. government and NASA’s space plans about the moon including the new moon mission ‘Artemis’ and the further steps after ~~more than 50 years~~ *over 50 years* waiting since the 1970s when American astronauts have landed on the moon. Also, Lucia introduces some reasons why the U.S. restarted those projects and some private space ventures of NASA. In the beginning of the article, the author talks about many significant and spectacular historical achievements made by the U.S. from 50 years ago. Then they talked about a series of space plans scheduled by NASA recently. After that the author unveils the reason why it has taken more than 50 years for NASA to restart the moon projects .At the end, Lucia talks about the private space projects supported by NASA and the influences.

When I heard that there was a person who had stepped on the moon when I was a child, I could hardly believe that it was true.However, I gradually understood the authenticity about that as I grew up. Because of more than 50 years of silence that nobody could land on the moon again, many incredulities and conspiratorial theories showed up saying the Apollo projects were a hoax. I was also curious about whether it was true about Apollo and whether Neil Armstrong really landed on the moon. I think I got some answers in the article. The author says money was the vital reason, which makes sense. Also, I think the development which other countries, especially China, have made is an essential factor as well which is also mentioned in the article.
Nevertheless, there are valuable resources in space which intrigue many countries and those researches and excavations of space like the moon or Mars definitely can push humans to a new era.Hopefully I could see some fantastic achievements of that just what we saw in some science fictions and movies.

  The second section “A Permanent Base” of this article introduces several moon projects managed by NASA. I think it’s less attractive and too brief. The author could describe more details about those projects, like “what happened after the launch of Artemis I has been postponed”, “what’s the details about the astronauts landing the moon of Artemis III”, Is there any pictures of that intriguing event ? I think it can attract readers to continue reading and immersing themselves into the passage.
