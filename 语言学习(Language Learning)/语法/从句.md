## 介词前置的现象
### who和whom需要注意的事项

### that和which和who的使用条件
1. 先行词是物，只能用that情况：
（基本表示强调时用that,也可以用介词+which）
先行词被序数词修饰
先行词同时有人和物
先行词是“all”时
句子前已经走了which或者who时
He is the only one of the boys that likes playing the piano.
All the glasses that on the table fell off onto the floor.
He likes the girl that she used to be.
2. 只能用which的情况：
非限定性定语从句中只能用which
3. 先行词是these those 而且指的是人的时候用who
4. 先行词是人，用who
### 主谓一致
先行词是the way时，用that  或者in which ,不用whic
one of 是复数
the only one of 才是单数
### 介词+关系代词的注意事项
1. where＝in which
2. when＝onwhich
3. why＝for which
4. 从句做地点状语 in front of which 后的从句主谓倒装
5. 从句中用被动（by which/whom）强调动作发出者
6. 介词和从句中的动词要搭配
7. 不定代词/数词+of+关系代词which/whom（both one none several some most any all）
8. 名词+of+which＝whose +名词：I saw some trees,the leaves of which were black with disease.
9. 介词+which或者whose修饰名词，during which/from whose: It rained all day and all night, during which time the ship was broken into pieces. The driver was the man, from whose room she had stoen the map.
10. 形容词最高级+of+which/whom
11. 介词+which+不定式：At last he had something about which to write.
