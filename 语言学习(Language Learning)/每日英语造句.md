> Not only should a good teacher teach their students knowledge and skills,but he also need to be a model of virtual to them imposing right and good quality into them,which could keep students from many bad things during their life experience like discrimination and violence. ^01
这句话中有一些语法问题和表达方面的不够清晰。以下是修正后的版本以及一些建议：
"A good teacher should not only impart knowledge and skills to their students but also serve as a role model *for* them, instilling the values of virtues, right conduct, and good qualities. This guidance helps students avoid negative experiences like discrimination and violence throughout their lives."
修正和建议的要点包括：

^9e040a

1. "Not only" 和 "but also" 之间不需要加 "should"。这两个短语已经表明了应该的含义。
2. "virtual" 是一个不太常见的词汇，这里更适合使用 "values" 或 "virtues" 来表示道德价值观。
3. "imposing" 可以被替换为 "instilling"，更能表达教师将道德观念灌输给学生的含义。句子结构有一些复杂，我对其进行了重新排列，以提高清晰度和可读性。
