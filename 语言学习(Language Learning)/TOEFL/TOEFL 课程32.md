## Feedback: 
Hi Jiahao! Today, we looked at your essay for Writing Task 1. You did a great job writing enough words for this task. We discussed that you need to pay attention to punctuation (no space between the word and punctuation, only after it), spelling, and grammar. You should always allow some time at the end to check your work. We also talked about adding some more information from the reading to your response, as it tended to be heavy with information from the lecture. It’s a good idea to have a template to help with this. You can check out the ideas on this website to come up with your own template for Writing Task 1:
