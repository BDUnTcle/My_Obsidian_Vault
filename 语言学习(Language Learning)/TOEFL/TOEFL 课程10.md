Northstar 5 Unit 1
Feedback: Hi Jiahao! Today, we discussed the interview from Northstar 5 Unit 1. Overall, you have good listening comprehension. You were able to discuss the main idea without hesitation. You did need to listen more than once for some details, but overall you did quite well. These types of listening exercises can help prepare you for the listening and speaking parts of the TOEFL. I’m sending you the audio for Unit 2 so you can complete it for next weekend. In Monday’s class we can discuss tips on how to take notes during TOEFL speaking.
