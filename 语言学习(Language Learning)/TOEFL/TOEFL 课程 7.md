Hi Jiahao! Today, we reviewed your answers for speaking question 4 and discussed HIBERNATION, OPTIMAL PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CAPACITY, and EVOLUTIONARY MECHANISMS. Your answers was well organized and you clearly stated both theories mentioned in the lecture. Just keep working on keeping your answer within the time limit. We also began the Northstar Level 5 Listening & Speaking Book today. You said you would prefer to do it as homework and discuss it in class. I’ll send you the book and the audio so you can complete it at your own pace, but try to at least do Lesson 1 by next class.
