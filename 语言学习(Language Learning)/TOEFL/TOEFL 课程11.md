# Lesson:
## TOEFL Speaking - How to Take Notes
Feedback: Hi Jiahao! Today, we looked at some tips on how to take notes during the speaking portion of the TOEFL. You mentioned how it was difficult to translate your notes into a comprehensible paragraph in the short amount of time given to answer the question. To practice this, I suggest you first practice writing down your response. Work on editing it and making it fit into the required response time. We will check your answers in the next class.
# Homework:
1. Listening & Speaking: Northstar Level 5 Unit 1 Lesson 2 - try to complete by next class
2. Vocabulary: Complete at least 1 lesson from the 400 Must-have Words for the TOEFL.
3. Speaking: Watch the video on how to take notes during the speaking part of the TOEFL. Practice using what you learned to answer the questions in the TOEFL Speaking practice video. Write down your answers so we can look at them next class.
