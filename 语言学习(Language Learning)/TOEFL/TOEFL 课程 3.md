## Feedback: 
Hi, Jiahao! It was great chatting with you today. In this lesson, we focused on the different types of speaking questions [PAIRED CHOICE, AGREE/DISAGREE, GOOD IDEA]. I think you have good ideas of how to answer these types of questions, but have trouble with the limited time you are given to respond (only 45 seconds! - it’s so short!). Please work on your timing for homework.

# Homework:
## 1. Speaking: Practice answering these speaking questions. Record yourself answering each question twice. Use a timer. First, give yourself 15 seconds to read the question and think about it. Then, speak for 45 seconds, answering the question. After that, take some time to look up any words or grammar rules that you need. Then, try answering the question again. Did you notice any improvements?
- Q1 -Agree/Disagree:
> Explain whether you agree or disagree with the following statement: “Every country should be required to reduce its carbon emissions by at least 25%.” Then give specific details in your argument

**running**

running is a great **aerobic excercise** 
**burning more calories in the same time** 
I have the habit of exercising , so running do not make I feel much discomfortable  and I love the feeling of swearing after runing 
the other reason 
- Q3 - Good Idea:
> Some health experts suggest that all liquids should be eliminated from one’s diet except water. Do you think that it is a good idea to only drink water? Give reasons and details to support your argument.

I dont think that's a good idea. 
the human body needs a variety of nutrients , such as protein and vitamins, and they all need to be obtained from food instead of water.
in my opinion ,if pepole want to loose weight , the combination of diet and exercise is important ,their diet should be cut down on fat and carbohydrates and do more aerobic sports instead of eating nothing but drinking water.
**vitamin** **unhealthy**  **cut down on fats and carbohydrates**
