## task 1（师生关系）
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
**Teachers should not be too friendly to their students.**
Use details and examples to explain your answer.

*sample:*
Personally, I do not agree with the idea that teacher should not be too friendly to their students.
Because first of all when teachers *maintain a good relationship with* their students whenever they *imposes certain requirements to* make sure students learing process can go smoothly. For example, students will always choose to follow these rules which will *make things easier* for both the teachers and students and also students will be more willing to ask teacher questions when they consider teachers as their firends, otherwise some students will just feel reluctant or even *intimidated* it to raise their questions which will *delay their learning process*.
So for these two reasons I beliee teachers should try to be students' friend instead of *pushing them away*. 
## task 2
<u>According to the reading,</u> the school is going to use a new degree navigation website.
First,the school believes that can help students to monitor their courses and also it can help to reduce the workload for academic advisors.
<u>The man in the conversation thinks it can be a great ideal</u>.
Because first of all, he says many students have to take a lot of classes and it's hard to organize them well. By using the website, students can do it better. For example, he has a friend who had to stay on campus last summer to get his degree because of missing some courses, which delayed his graduation.
Second, he says it will save time of advisors who are professor as well at the same time for those really serious issues of students, such like switching major and getting internship. 

*sample*:
<u>From the reading, we konw that</u> students will soon be able to use a new *degree navigator website*.
<u>First of all, the school believes</u> that this website can *make it easier for students* to *monitor their courses* and also *reduce the workload for* academic advisors.
<u>The man in the conversation thinks this can be a great idea.</u>
Because, first of all, students have a lot of classes to take and it's hard to *stay organized*. So this website can be really helpful to avoid making mistakes. For example, he has a friend who had to *stay on campus* last summer to take courses to get his degree wich delayed his graduation.
<u>And also about second point,</u> the academic advisors truly are so busy since they are professor as well and they have lots of other works to do. So if the website can help them, they can have more time to talk to students about more serious issues like swithing majors and getting internships.

## task 3
*sample：*
<u>The reading passage talks about</u> a term named "nearfield sound detection" meaning a kind of ability that allows some animals to detect vibrations of the nearfield sounds produced by their *potential predators*.
<u>In the lecture, the professor used a example of</u> caterpillar <u>to explain this concept</u>.
When the caterpillar is *crawling along on* the branch of a tree, and a *wasp* flys toward it, which can be a threat. Other animals may not be able to hear the wasp but there are really tiny hairs on the caterpillars' skin so the beating of the wings of the wasp sends out some vibrations in the air which will make the hairs on the caterpillar skin move so when a caterpillar senses *the presence of the wasp*, it just drop off from the branch it's been crawling on and fall onto the ground then the wasp will just fly by without catching it and the caterpillar can be safe in this way.
So this is the example in the lecture.
## task 4
*sample：*
<u>In the lecture, the professor talks about</u> 2 disadvantages of decentralization for large companies which have multiple branches or locations.
The first is that decisions made by local managers may harm the overall company. For example in a clothing company that has a lot of stores, one sotre *is not doing well* and the manager of that store may decide to *spend* a lot of money *on advertisement* but if the *central office* were *in control*, it might just choose to close that store and invest the money on more successful branches.
The second disadvantage is that the company's policy may be *carried out differently* in different locations which can make customers unhappy. For example in a clothing store, customers may just want  to return their clothes that don't fit and get their money back, but one store doesn't accept the returns. So customers at that store may just get upset.
these are 2 disadvantages of decentralization.

## task 1
**prefer to get information from books or via the Internet**

## task 2
sample：
From the reading we know that the university is going to  build a cafe in the basement of the library.
First of all, they believe students can enjoy the convenience of eating without to leave the library
and also this can help to make the library studies more productive since the students can take breaks in the cafe.
The woman however in the conversation disagrees with the plan.
First she said when students don't have to leave the library and walk all the way to the school cafeteria, that's actually the problem since the cafe only serves unhealthy snakes. At leaset the school cafeteria has some healthy foods which is gonna to be better for students.
Next, she does not think are going to be more productive like when their friends are just chatting down infront of the cafe,students will be tempted to go down there and join them so they are not going to concentrate on any actual work. In other words,they are not going to be more productive as expected.

---
## task 3
sample:
The reading passage introduces a concept named "The paradox of choice" meaning a phenomenon when the number of choices or options available to people increases, the effort required to make a good decision increase as well.
In the psychology lecture the professor used an example of himself to explain this concept.
When he went shopping for a pair of jeans last week, all he wanted was just a regular pair of jeans but the salesperson in the store told him that he could choose between 5 different styles of jeans and a dozen colors straight or baggy,jeans with buttons or zipper so before, it was easy for him to decide but now he just went back and forth only narrowing the choice down to 4 different color that looked good. So it only like took 5minutes for him decide before but now it had turned into a 2 hour project. The whole process gave him a headache and he end up leaving the store anxious instead of feeling satisfied with the purchase. 

---
## task 4
In the enviromental science lecture, the professor mainly talks about 2 advantages of the controlled forest fire to a healthy ecosystem.
The first advantage is that forest fire can be beneficial to the reproduction of certain plant species. For instance the pine trees need forest fire to help them to spread seeds since pine trees have pine cones and the heat of the fire can help melting the resin that hold cone scales together when pine cones open up the seeds inside them can be released on the ground so the young pine trees can grow from them.
Second, the forest fire can create a better habitat for wildlife because the forest fire can open up the forest area which is previously thick with trees so when the sunshine is let in it can ecourage the growth of the grasses and shrubs and this will bring in new animal species.
So these are the two advantages of the controlled forest fire.

**Q: Explain whether you agree or disagree with the following statement :
"Robot could replace a majority of the jobs in the next decade."**
- skills that AI Programs/Robots can not replicate 
- socital issues
## gpt回答
I disagree with the statement that robots will replace a majority of jobs in the next decade. 
*While* technology and automation have impacted the workforce, there are certain skills that robots cannot replicate, *such as* *creativity*, *critical thinking*, *problem-solving*, and *interpersonal communication*. 
*Additionally*, the *implementation* of robotics requires significant investment and *infrastructure*, which may not be *feasible* for all businesses. Job creation and transformation are also likely to occur as technology advances. *Finally*, considering the social and *ethical implications*, a complete shift to a robotic workforce may *lead to income inequality* and *societal issues*. *Therefore*, human labor will continue to be essential in various industries, and complete job replacement by robots is unlikely.

**Q：Do you prefer to go to bed earlier at night around 9:00 PM or to do like to stay up until 12:00 AM?**
- lacking sleep could be bad for health
- sleep early get up early keep oneself better in the whole day 

there's a lot of research in statistics that has indicated that  lack of sleep can be harmful to the human body 
so if you stay up until the night especially past midnight and still have to work or study the next day you won't get your body fully rest

Personally, I prefer going to bed earlier in the evening rather than staying up late. There are several reasons for this preference. Firstly, numerous studies in the field of statistics have shown that inadequate sleep can have negative effects on the human body. So, if you stay up late at night, especially past midnight, and still have work or studying to do the following day, you won't be able to fully rest and recharge. Secondly, by going to bed earlier, you can wake up earlier in the morning, allowing you to shift tasks that you would typically do at night to the morning. I believe this promotes a healthier lifestyle overall.

## 2.Conversations

### chatgpt修改
The passage states that the university intends to replace traditional-bound textbooks with electronic textbooks. 
However, ~~in the conversation~~, the woman expresses her disagreement with the college's decision. 
Firstly, she argues that traditional textbooks are *cost-effective*, while she believes electronic textbooks may require more frequent replacement due to new versions or features. 
Secondly, **she questions the convenience of electronic textbooks**, finding the small size challenging to manipulate with fingers. 
Lastly, she strongly prefers the traditional approach of using physical textbooks.
### 范文：
Well,**according to the plan** the university is to **switch from** tranditional-bound textbooks to electronic textbooks early next year **for two reasons**.
**However the woman disagrees with the plan for several reasons**. 
**Firstly**,she believes that it's not realistic for the cost issue since it'll still cost  the students a lot when they break their devices or when they wish to get the devices upgraded for some new features they want.
**Besides**,she thinks that the device itself is too small so it's difficult for even the *normal-sized-fingered students* to handle the key pad or buttons, leting alone selecting or underlining and stuff like that.
**Finally** she personally favors the tranditional way of *studing material* because she thinks it's more comfortable. 
**All in all** **, the woman disagrees with the plan for reasons stated above**.
