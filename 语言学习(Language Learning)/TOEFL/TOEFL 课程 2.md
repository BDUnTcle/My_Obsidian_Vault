## Feedback: 
Hi Jiahao. It was great speaking with you today. We focused on speaking in this lesson. We did an exercise in which you looked at a picture and tried to describe it for 45 seconds. This is a good exercise you can do for homework. It will help improve your vocabulary. If you write down what you say (or record yourself), you can then go back and look at your grammar as well. Grammar and vocabulary were the two things you mentioned you wanted to focus on, and I agree. Try this exercise at home when looking at a magazine or some pictures online.

# Homework:
## 1. Look at the pictures. Describe them. How are they similar? How are they different? Which one do you prefer? Why?
- The left picture is several person study in a library while the right one is a man in his bedroom maybe ? because I can see a part of bed a little bit.The man in the right picture wear a earphone
- They both use the laptop and in study, The different is the library is a public place while the man in a private place
- Both of them are good , but I prefer the right one a little bit. Generaly , Because I think that a private enviroment could let me feel more comfortable and improve my learning efficiency. And I can start the study or work just after my breakfast like the man in the picture so I don't have to go library.It also saves my time.
## 2. Practice using linking words. Complete exercises B, C, and D (see image)
## 3. Complete at least 1 lesson from the 400 Must-have Words for the TOEFL.
