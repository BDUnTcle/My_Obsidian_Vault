TOEFL Listening Practice 
# Feedback: 
Hi Jiahao! Today, talked about the Holiday Adjustment Policy and your trip to Mount Lu. Then, we did a listening practice test for the TOEFL iBT. We discussed the term DRIP ART, like that of Jackson Pollock, and the idiom “to have a blast.” It means to have a great time. For homework, you can complete the listening test. I’ll provide you with the script and answers so you can check your work.
