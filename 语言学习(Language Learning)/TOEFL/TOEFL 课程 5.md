## Feedback: 
It was great chatting with you today, Jiahao. Today, we focused on the structure of the TOEFL Speaking Questions 3 and 4. You have a good understanding of how these questions are structured and what the scorers are looking for in a high quality response. We both agree that the thing you need to focus on most when answering these questions is condensing your response so that you don’t go over the allotted time (60 seconds for questions 3 and 4).

# Homework:
### Speaking 
- Question 3 - Review your answer for Question 3 about VAT Theory. Try to condense your answer so that you can say it in 60 seconds.
> The VAK Theory is a theory of teaching.It' meaning Visual Audio and Kinesthetic. According to the professors said,a teacher want to teach kids about trees in the kindergarten.First,the teacher told kids about tree's name and played a game with them.However , because the lack of imagination about trees,chirdrens still didn't know about it.So then the teacher show some photos of trees and take kids outside ,letting them physically identify the trees.At the end childrens had a clearly definition about trees.That's a practical VAK teaching.


- Question 4: Listen to the talk. Take notes. Prepare what you will say in 20 seconds. Using information from the talk, describe what we know about water on Mars, and how we know it. Speak for 60 seconds. (see audio attachment).
