I definitely agree with that such different devices can make a better experiences in reading. Those method not only can enhance reader's curiosity when they are reading but also make the literature more structive and better organized, like Kris said. For example, I want to talk about one of my own reading experiences. I once read a detective book. The author use foreshadowing at the begining of the story. When the author said "The murderer is already showed in the before scene", my curiosity and emotions had been complitely aroused. I can't wait to read the whole story and find the truth. So using specific literature devices can really help author to make there works better and improving reading experience.

In my opinion, art isn't just for fun but also play a significant role in expressing people's emotion and reflecting the facts about the  society. Like Susana said, art has influenced many fields in different forms. For example, painting, one form of art, can reflect the social phenomenon. There are many painters use their brush to record the history and their world when the camera had not been invented. Like the paintings in the Renaissance, those paintings recorded people's life in that age, helping  historians to do research about the history. Besides, many artists use their work to express their view and attitude of the society. Therefore, art sometimes can not be just seen as an entertainment, it has great influence to the society.
