**第一次写作**：
The reading passage and the lecture both talk about the new kind of broccoli which can survive in the hotter enviroment. When the reading thinks it would bring benifits to the people live in the East Coast of the U.S., the professor in the lecture,however gives different opinion to it.

According to the reading, the cost people live in the East Coast to buy broccoli will donw since there is no need to transport those broccoli which grow in the West Coast to the east because the new broccoli can be raised in the east enviroment. This statement however is challenged by the lecture. The professor said the price of broccoli in the West Coast may suffer from this kind of process since raising broccoli in the east will decrease the yeild of broccoli in the west. It lead to higher price in the West Cost.
