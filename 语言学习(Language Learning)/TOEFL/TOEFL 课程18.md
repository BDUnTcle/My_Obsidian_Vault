# Lesson: 
Northstar 5 Listening & Speaking Unit 2
# Feedback:
Hi Jiahao! Today, we discussed Northstar Unit 2. You reviewed some vocabulary words and expressions from the beginning of the unit and also learned some new ones. Then, you practiced using modals of deduction in the past, present, and future. You learned which modals to use when expressing varying degrees of certainty. I’ve added some websites with further explanation and practice of this. Next class we can complete Unit 2 in Northstar and review your speaking answers from the TOEFL Speaking Test video. If we have time, we will begin the listening portion of the TOEFL.
