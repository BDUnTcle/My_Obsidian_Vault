## Feedback: 
Thanks so much for your hard work today, Jiahao! Today, we discussed the second part of the speaking test where you must first read a text, then listen to a conversation. Then, you must give a summary stating a person’s opinion. We didn’t do a timed practice with this question, so I suggest you do it at home for homework. We can discuss any uncertainties in the next class.
