# Lesson: 
-   TOEFL Speaking Practice
# Feedback: 
Hi Jiahao! Today, we reviewed the TOEFL speaking test. We worked on trimming your answers down so that you can say them in the allotted time (45 or 60 seconds depending on the task number). We also worked on eliminating passes and filler words (um, uh, etc.). While it’s great that you are using advanced vocabulary and complex sentences in your answers, if it’s making your speaking answers too long, it’s better the get rid of them. The most important thing is that you answer the question completely and in the allotted time (without going over). We practiced this in class by looking at two pictures, writing down words and synonyms for what we saw, writing sentences and then trimming them. You can do this at home as well.
# Homework:
Finish speaking exercises. Record your answers so we can discuss them in class.
