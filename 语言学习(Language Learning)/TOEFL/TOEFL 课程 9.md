# Homework Review:
Will discuss Northstar 5 Unit 1 next class.
# Lesson: 
Speaking Practice Test Questions 1-3
# Feedback: 
Hi Jiahao! Today, we completed the first 3 questions in a practice speaking test. We discussed the differences between reading physical books and digital books. You listened to a professor talk about culture shock and what it means. You did a great job answering the first question. The second question’s response was a little too long, as was the third. We looked at a template to help you cut down on your speaking time. Feel free to edit the template as you see fit. In the next class, we can look at some tips on how to take notes.
