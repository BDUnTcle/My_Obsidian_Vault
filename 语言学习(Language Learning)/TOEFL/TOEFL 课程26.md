TOEFL Reading Test Practice - Vocabulary questions https://tstprep.com/topic/toefl-reading-practice-questions-sample-vocabulary/ 
Feedback: 
Hi Jiahao! Today, we discussed the updates to the TOEFL iBT. You can find the updates here (https://www.ets.org/toefl/test-takers/ibt/about/content.html). The main things are that the test is now under 2 hours and there is a new writing question. Next, we looked at the homework about vocabulary type reading questions. Overall, you did great with these using different methods for finding the right answer. Lastly, we talked about root words from Latin and Greek. I’ll send you this for homework as well as some videos which talk about prefixes and suffixes. I think it will help you in these types of vocabulary reading questions.
# Homework:
- Videos to watch (it says it’s for kids, but I think it’s great for everyone. The videos are short and to the point and have some good examples):
	prefixes: Prefixes - Language Skills for Kids! - YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7oGNyHX81I)
	suffixes: Suffixes - Language Skills for Kids! - YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=635oQTY61J8)
	root words: Latin and Greek Root Words - Language Skills for Kids! - YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWyX8vl6kMs)
Matching exercise:
Match the root word to the meaning. Then, figure out the meaning of the word.
