# Feedback: 
Hi Jiahao! Today, we looked at your notes for the TOEFL Speaking Test and discussed your answers. You did great on all questions. Your answers were thorough and contained all parts of the lectures and readings. .Your answers for Questions 3 and 4 were just a few seconds too long, so please continue to work on your timing. Try to trim them, omit words, or rearrange your sentences so you have enough time to say what you need to say. At the end of the lesson, we began looking at how the listening test is structured. Please finish watching the videos for homework. I’ll send that along with a listening test that you can try to complete for the next class, so we can discuss it next time.
