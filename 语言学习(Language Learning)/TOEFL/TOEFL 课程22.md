Hi Jiahao! Today, we looked at your answers for the TOEFL listening test and discussed those you had trouble with. Overall, you have a good understanding of how to answer gist questions. Some of the detail questions were more difficult, depending on the topic discussed. To help you with these, please check out the listening tips video for homework. I’ve also included another TOEFL listening with answers so you can practice at home. Next class, we can go over them and discuss any questions or concerns you have.
