# Lesson: 
TOEFL Speaking
# Feedback: 
Hi Jiahao! Today, we looked at your notes for the TOEFL Speaking Test and discussed your answers. You did great on Questions 1 and 2. You answered the question fully and completed it in the allotted time. Your answers for Question 3 and 4 were great. They included all parts of the reading/listening. However, you went over on time with both of your answers. We discussed how to trim your answers by omitting words or restructuring your sentences. We will look at your answers for the next speaking test on Thursday. Then we will take a look at the structure of the listening test.
